### Why
Now is the point in your Turing education to start on your job search, and through this session, we'll discuss tools to use to approach the job search in an intentional way that will also make the search less overwhelming.  

### Overview of Session
Session length: 60 minutes

* Opening (10 mins)
* Job Searching Tracking (10 mins)
* Tools & Discussion of Process (10 mins)
* Demo: Walking Through an Application (10 mins)

### Opening  
#### Reflection & Turn & Talk
Open up your notebook and reflect:

* What are all the things you should do for a successful job search as a junior developer? 

After 5 minutes of reflecting on this question, turn and talk with a partner to share what you've written. 


The traditional way to look for jobs isn't necessarily the best route. 

Applying for jobs on sites like monster.com, Indeed, and other career listing sites can be discouraging and ineffective. As little as [20-30% of job listings](http://www.npr.org/2011/02/08/133474431/a-successful-job-search-its-all-about-networking) are being posted online. That means that when you're only looking at company job postings, you are decreasing your chances of finding a job significantly. 

In contrast, [referral candidates](http://www.careerxroads.com/news/SourcesOfHire2013.pdf) are 3-4 times more likely to be hired than non-referral candidates. To add yourself to those numbers, today we'll talk about how to find a job without relying on just a job application. 


#### Objectives

* Describe a step-by-step plan for a job application, including research, outreach, and follow-up
* Create and effectively use a job search tracker for your job search
* Start a list of companies and jobs to research

### Prep for Your Job Search: Using a Tracker
The first step to a successful job search is to utilize a tracking system. Having a system to keep track of everything from companies you're interested in to notes from coffee meetings will be highly beneficial in staying organized in the job search. We'll get set up today using [Huntr](https://huntr.co/):

* Start by reading through this guide to [using Huntr here](https://help.huntr.co/for-job-seekers/huntr-quickstart-guide)

#### Your Turn
Take 5 minutes to set up your Huntr using the invitation you got in your email.  

### The Process
So if you aren't going to just apply to a posting on a job board, what is your process?

Here are helpful tips for the process:
1. Find a job posting that interests you
  * Use one of the job searching tools below
2. Conduct research
  * Go to the company's site and find out about their mission, product, customer base, blog posts
  * Conduct a Google search on articles or other information about the company
  * If the company has any open source projects on GitHub, check them out
  * Find people who work at the company using LinkedIn
3. Do some cold outreach
  * Who do you reach out to?
    * Developers: Both juniors and seniors will be helpful to talk to and find out information about the company, what it's like to work there, and what to expect in the interview process
    * Use LinkedIn to see if you have any mutual connections who can make an introduction
  * Set up a coffee meeting or phone call
    * Ask questions! Gather information to use in your cover letter and resume
4. Complete the Application
  * Customize your resume for the position
  * Write a tailored cover letter
  * Mention the contact you met
5. Go back to your Contact
  * Let them know you've applied

Update Jobtrack in every step of the process. 

### Where to Begin: Finding the Job Posting
In order to find job postings and begin conducting research, here are some tools you should check out:

* [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/)
   * Tips: 
      * Use the "Advanced Search" tool to find people based on skillset, location, and industry OR names of companies and select the "People who work at..." option

      * In "Location" type in the area where you'd like to work
      * In "Industry" select "computer software"
      * Search: Of those profiles that return, look at their profiles to see the list of companies they've worked for. What companies do you want to continue to research? Who do you want to connect with? 
      * You can also click on the company’s page and on the right side, view "Similar Companies" where your connections work

#### The Essential Step in the Process: Building Your Network & Conducting Outreach
In addition to finding the right posting, remember that the next step is to find a face at the company to connect with. LinkedIn will be your go-to site for this, but a great way to continue the research into places you want to work that are aligned with your goals is by building your network. Below are some suggestions for groups to utilize for this purpose:

* [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/)
   * Tips: Search for groups local to the area you’re interested in working and in topics that you're interested in pursuing (i.e. Ruby, JavaScript, etc.). Be sure to select "Groups" (not "Calendar"). On the group page, there are two things that will be very useful to your job search:
      * Organizers list: who are they? Where do they work? What other meetups are they active in?
      * Upcoming events: look at the RSVP list; Who else is going? What companies do they work for? 
* [BeVisible](https://www.bevisible.soy/) is a career network for Latinxs.
* [Black Data Processing Associates](https://www.bdpa.org/default.aspx) is an international organization for Black professionals in tech. 
* [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/) is a community for newcomers to code.
* [Lesbians Who Tech](https://lesbianswhotech.org/) is a career network for lesbians. 
* [MAES](http://mymaes.org/) was founded in Los Angeles in 1974 to increase the number of Mexican Americans and other Hispanics in the technical and scientific fields. 
* [National Society of Black Engineers](http://www.nsbe.org/home.aspx) is one of the largest student-governed organizations with the aim to increase the number of culturally responsible Black Engineers.
* [Out in Tech](https://outintech.com/#welcome) is a community to connect LGBTQ+ in tech. 
* [TechLatino](http://techlatino.org/) is an organization to empower Latino technological and scientific engagement.
* [Tech Ladies](https://www.hiretechladies.com/) is a community for women and non-binary folks. You have to apply to join, but once accepted, you'll have access to jobs from partnering companies.
* [Trans Tech Social Enterprises](https://www.transtechsocial.org/) is an incubator for LGBTQ Talent with a focus on economically empowering transgender people.

**Debrief:** Discuss whole group takeaways and questions

### Demo: Group Practice
As a whole group, we'll find a job listing to go through. Using this job listing, I'm going to update my Trello and create a plan for outreach using the guidelines we discussed last module in the [Outreach & Networking Session](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/outreach_and_networking.md):

* Update my contacts -- how do I find contact information?
* Craft my email -- what should I say? 
* Create a task/Set up a meeting

Need more help? Join the #cold-outreach channel and come to their sessions

**What else?**

* Describe a plan for research
* Create a tailored resume for the position
* Write a tailored cover letter for the position
* Research the technologies/libraries the company uses to use in an upcoming project

### Your Turn: Conduct Research & Update Your Tracker
You have 15 minutes now to get started researching and adding opportunities you're interested in to your Jobtrack.io account.

### Closing & Next Steps
It's important to take the time now to organize your job search. Take these steps to make this process less daunting and empower yourself. 

Next week, you'll be going on **Job Shadowing**. We know that this is *not* a job interview, but it is an opportunity to create connections with others in the industry. Add contact information and other info to your Jobtrack from your Job Shadowing experience. 

Here are other expectations:

* Keep your phones off/out of reach 
* Don't drink alcohol prior to the shadow
* Dress professionally -- doesn't need to be overly dressy, focus on business casual
* Come prepared with questions

For further preparation, please read this feedback from an alum at Ibotta who participated in the employer side of job shadowing: 
```As a Turing grad who benefitted greatly from shadowing, it's a pleasure to be able to hopefully provide the same benefit to Turing students who shadow me at Ibotta. I have a bit of feedback for future shadowing students: It's best not to consume anything before the shadowing that might cause one's breath to smell like alcohol. If it's not alcohol, then sometimes chewing tobacco can cause this odor. When you're sitting right next to someone you're shadowing, they will smell it. So that's something Turing students might want to be aware of before they shadow. Another thing is that it's best not to check your phone while the person you're shadowing is trying to show you things. It's rude and shows that you're unengaged during time that the person has taken out of their day to hopefully show you useful stuff. Another thing I'd recommend is for students to come prepared with questions. This is a rare opportunity to learn what life is like outside of Turing, and it's a shame to not take advantage of it. Respectfully asking questions also evidences engagement and interest on the part of the student. I am so glad that Turing offers its students this opportunity, and it was something that I found really useful.```
