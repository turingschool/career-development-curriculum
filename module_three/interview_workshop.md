### Opening
Let's start by thinking about this question: *how well do you know yourself?*

That question is the essence of the non-technical interview. To ace this part of the interview, you want to bring a level of self-awareness to the process so that you can confidently answer any question asked of you. 

In this session, you'll focus on combining all the professional development pieces you've worked on this module (your resume, your professional story, your flower exercise, your research, your job shadowing experience) and in previous modules to help you answer common interview questions. 

### Objectives
* Practice answering common culture interview questions
* Provide effective feedback for each other on responses
* Put feedback into practice
* Come away from this session with a clear plan on how to improve your interviewing process

### Deliverables
* Complete your resume edits
* Complete your Turing portfolio
* Complete PD Peer Groups Survey

#### Modeling the Process
How would you answer one of the following questions?

* Why do you want to be a software developer?
* Describe a successful idea or project you worked on. What are some of the challenges you had to overcome? What made it a success?
* Describe a project that failed, a project you had to give up on or a time you worked really hard on a project and it just didn’t pan out as expected. What happened? How did you make the decisions that you made?
* What is your approach to working on a team?
* What is an area of growth for you?
* Describe your strengths. How have you seen these in practice as a developer?

What have you learned about yourself that you can pull from in these answers?

* Discuss StrengthsFinder -- how do these results play out for you in teams? How do they describe you?
* Connect to feedback you’ve gotten from partners -- how have you used this feedback to grow?
* Connect to prior experience / values / reflections

#### Interview Prep Tips
When answering an interview question, keep the acronym [STAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result) in mind:

* **Situation:** The interviewer wants you to present a recent challenge and situation in which you found yourself.
* **Task:** What were you required to achieve? The interviewer will be looking to see what you were trying to achieve from the situation. Some performance development methods use “Target” rather than “Task”. Job interview candidates who describe a “Target” they set themselves instead of an externally imposed “Task” emphasize their own intrinsic motivation to perform and to develop their performance.
* **Action:** What did you do? The interviewer will be looking for information on what you did, why you did it, and what the alternatives were.
* **Results:** What was the outcome of your actions? What did you achieve through your actions and did you meet your objectives? What did you learn from this experience and have you used this learning since?

**Other Tips:**
* Create a doc to keep track of technical concepts you're practicing, behavioral answers, and feedback
* Review:
  * Your professional story
  * Feedback you've received
  * Your projects; Go through your projects to reflect on:
    * One specific bug
    * Something that was really hard
    * Something that was rewarding
    * Any interesting struggles/insights about the collaboration process 
  * Your Flower Exercise
  * Your strengths
  * Your areas of growth
  * DTR Memos
  * Retro notes
  * Eval notes
* Utilize your resources:

#### Demo
As a class, talk through the following questionS and think about how you could answer it:

**What makes you stand out compared to other junior developers?**

Consider:
* What is this question asking you to do?
* What are the components that go into answering this question?
* What background knowledge about yourself could you bring in here?
* Anything else to keep in mind when answering this question?

**Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with a colleague and how you resolved it.**

* What is this question asking you to do?
* What are the components that go into answering this question?
* Use the STAR method
* Anything else to keep in mind when answering this question?

### Transition
Now, find a partner or group of 3 to work through questions of your choice *(you don't have to work on the same question as your partner).* 

### Three Rounds of Questions
Step 1: Prep. Take 5 minutes to write or think through your answer to one of the questions
Step 2: Answer the questions with your partner(s). Provide feedback on the answers. Remember to be *specific, actionable, and kind*. 
Step 3: Discuss how you will incorporate the feedback to improve your answer.

### Whole Group Debrief
* What are your takeaways from this practice?
* What will you focus on in your continued interview prep?
* What do you need support on in Mod 4?

### Prep for Mod 4
Using the practice from today, think about your job search that starts next mod, and fill out the survey for Module 4 PD Peer Groups.

### Closing
Create a plan to get your resume and Turing portfolio finished by next week's portfolio review. 

As you finish up Module 3, come back to these questions that we posed at the beginning of the session. Assess how confident you feel to answer any of these as you keep going with your job search.
