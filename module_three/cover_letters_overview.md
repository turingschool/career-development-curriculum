### Do's & Don't's of a Cover Letter
**Whole Group Discussion:** What is the purpose of a cover letter?

With a cover letter, you are:

* Introducing yourself
* Creating a connection between you and the job/company
* Providing insight into how you would do this work

Here are some things to keep in mind when writing a cover letter:

* Keep your cover letters to 1 page. 2-3 paragraphs is standard. 
* Here are some suggested ways to structure the letter:
  * Paragraph #1: Introduce yourself -- *briefly.*
      * Explain why you are applying for the position and include some research into the company
      * Give a brief version of your professional story; why does this company and this position specifically fit into your next step in your career?
      * Consider including a **hook** to connect to the reader and give a sense of your personality
      * If you have any connection at the company, mention them here
  * Paragraph #2: Highlight your skills specific to the job posting
      * This is *not* a rehashing of your resume. Rather, what do you want the reader to notice about your resume? What extra detail can you provide here?
      * Go more in-depth about a certain project or discuss an example of how you've done similar work to what the company is looking for
  * Paragraph #3: Connect the first two paragraphs by talking about how you are the best fit to build *value* for the company
      * This letter is about helping the company see how you uniquely will help them meet their goals. Paint that picture for them. Emphasize how you will not only flourish in this role but you also have the drive and ability to keep growing professionally, take on more responsibility, and benefit the company in ways beyond the initial position for which you're applying.
      * How can you apply your background and skills to make great experiences for the company's users/customers? What can you leave them with that will make them want to contact you?
      * Include information about your availability for interviews and/or references if applicable
      
That being said, this template is more like an outline to keep in mind when structuring your thoughts. **The most important thing is that the cover letter has your unique voice and does not come across like a generic copy.** 

**Frequently Made Mistakes in Cover Letters:**
| Mistake      | Solution     | 
|--------------|--------------|
| Very long/wordy cover letters | Shorter paragraphs to be easily skimmable; Cut out extraneous details | 
| Cover letter is all about you | Only talk about yourself in the context of this job and company to demonstrate how you will provide value |  
| Grammar and spelling errors | Use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) or the [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) | 


Don’t talk about what you’re hoping to **get** from the company (i.e., mentorship, culture, etc.). The letter should be all about what you’re going to **give** the company as an employee.

To ensure you're hitting the right points, you can use this [Cover Letter Checklist](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/cover_letter_checklist.md)

#### Examples
Let's discuss as a group:

Turn & Talk to discuss these other 2 examples:

* [Tommasina Miller](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Example%20Cover%20Letter.pdf)

* What do you notice about this cover letter? 
* What story are they telling?
* What value does this person bring to this company? How do you know? 

### We Do
As a whole group, let's look at a job posting and decide what we'd put in a cover letter for it. We'll discuss:

* What do we notice in the job description that stands out to us? 
* What can we pull out to discuss in the cover letter?
* What research should we do?
* How can we use our professional story here?

### Workshop Time
Form groups of 2-3 people in your program and draft out a cover letter for the position picked for your program. 

### Round of Feedback: Pair & Share
Team up with a group not in your program to share your cover letters and give each other feedback. Feedback should be **specific, actionable, and kind** and include both **appreciation and coaching.** 

### Closing
Debrief as a whole group:

* What are your next steps/takeaways from today's session?
