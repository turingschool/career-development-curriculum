[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OgKR2tBd3E-Sd6B1lpmJYr5Dx1LdFR_YzGQttKHZj64/edit?usp=sharing)

### Opening
Today, we're going to talk about preparing for the behavioral interview, looking specifically at these common questions:

* Tell me about yourself. Why do you want to be a software developer?
* Describe a successful idea or project you worked on. What are some of the challenges you had to overcome? What made it a success?
* Describe a time when you received feedback that you were surprised by. What did you do with that feedback?

Participants take 10 minutes to prep their answers for these questions.

### Review
Let's go over some interview techniques that we [first discussed in Module Three's session](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/interview_workshop.md). The STAR method is an effective way to break down an answer for most interview questions:

* **Situation:** The interviewer wants you to present a recent challenge and situation in which you found yourself.
* **Task:** What were you required to achieve? The interviewer will be looking to see what you were trying to achieve from the situation. Some performance development methods use “Target” rather than “Task”. Job interview candidates who describe a “Target” they set themselves instead of an externally imposed “Task” emphasize their own intrinsic motivation to perform and to develop their performance.
* **Action:** What did you do? The interviewer will be looking for information on what you did, why you did it, and what the alternatives were.
* **Results:** What was the outcome of your actions? What did you achieve through your actions and did you meet your objectives? What did you learn from this experience and have you used this learning since?

Whole Group:
* What can this look like in practice? Let's look at some examples:
    * The 2nd and 3rd questions here are asking about specific situations that would have a specific goals/outcomes, so the STAR method would work well here
    * What other examples would apply here?
* How could you use STAR to help you prep for interviews?
* With what kinds of questions would STAR *not* be an effective framework?
   
### Model
Using these questions, facilitators model answering the questions effectively and break down the answers in a Q&A with students:

* Tell me about yourself. Why do you want to be a software developer?
* Describe a successful idea or project you worked on. What are some of the challenges you had to overcome? What made it a success?
* Describe a time when you received feedback that you were surprised by. What did you do with that feedback?

In the model, we'll discuss:

* Why the interviewer has asked this question and what they might be looking for
* What you want to emphasize in your answer
* What you should stay away from in your answer

Keep in mind that even seemingly "simple" questions can be derailed by an answer that isn't directly answering the question. 

Participants can also go back to their notes and make revisions to their initial prep notes.

### Practice
Participants get into pairs to practice these interview questions and answers with each other. Depending on attendance size, these can be small groups. 

If participants have extra time, they can pull more from the bank of interview questions listed here to continue practicing with each other:

* What made you switch from your prior career into programming? 
* Describe to me the steps you would take to build out a product.
* Tell me how you solve a problem.
* Describe your background. How did you get to where you are now? What was your previous career field? What did you like about it? What didn’t you like about it? Why coding? 
* Describe your time at Turing. What worked for you? What didn’t work for you? What was the structure of the program?
* Describe your teamwork experience in a coding environment. How big of a team did you work with?
* A lot of this job will be full-stack. Your experience is largely ____ (Back End, Front End). How do you feel like you’d be able to contribute to the team with only that experience? How comfortable are you with getting uncomfortable with a new language?
* Describe your coding experience and why you wish to continue?
* What are you looking for in a company? Why would you want to work here?
* Describe an example of how you have handled a stressful situation.
* Have you ever had to switch gears in the middle of a project to get something fixed immediately? How did you react?
* What is your 100% ideal role for your first web development job?
* Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with a colleague and how you resolved it.
* What project of yours are you most proud of and why? 
* Explain one of the most difficult code problems you’ve had to solve, either on your own authored code, or in contributing to someone else’s.
* Describe a time when you received feedback that you were surprised by. What did you do with that feedback?
* Describe a successful idea or project you worked on. What are some of the challenges you had to overcome? What made it a success?
* Describe a project that failed, a project you had to give up on or a time you worked really hard on a project and it just didn’t pan out as expected. What happened? How did you make the decisions that you made?
* What is your approach to working on a team?
* What is an area of growth for you?
* Describe your strengths. How have you seen these in practice as a developer?
