### Opening & Objectives
In this session, students will be able to:

* Understand what should (and should not) go in a cover letter
* Practice writing cover letters
* Give and receive feedback on cover letters
* Implement changes and new learnings into a cover letter draft in order to submit it

### Do's & Don't's of a Cover Letter
**Hook:** When you talk to someone that you want to be friends with, what kind of information do you share about yourself? What kind of impression do you want them to have? Your cover letter should provide that same impression. 



### We Do
As a whole group, we'll find a job posting and write a cover letter together. 

### Workshop Time
Participants write a cover letter for the job posting that they brought with them to the session. 

### Round of Feedback
Each participant will get 5 minutes to spend on their cover letter to get feedback from the group. Feedback should be **specific, actionable, and kind** and include both **appreciation and coaching.** 

For larger groups, participants can be broken up in smaller groups, with a max of 8 people per group.

### Revision Time
Use the next 10 minutes to revise your cover letter according to feedback you received and then send in your application.

### Closing
Debrief as a whole group:

* What are you taking away from today's session?
