# Guidelines: Documentation of Practice/Actual Interview Participation

**Directions**: 
During Module 4, you've had a few in-class models and practice sessions for technical interviews. You may have also participated in mock interviews or actual interviews outside of these class sessions. Please write a summary and reflection of 4-6 sentences on your interview participation in a gist that you'll link in your career development deliverables file.

Suggested ideas to include in your reflection:

* What happened in the interview/practice?
* What are some best practices of technical interviews that you've discussed?
* What did you excel at in the practice?
* What will you continue to practice as you prep for interviews in the future?
* What surprised you about the practice?
