# Mindful Communication



["PPT"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_Hwbih1rkVVyTc8SiEYsZbo9d1jWIDzLUao_GM9ZY4g/edit#slide=id.g1eee055cc6_1_111)


## Opening (5 min)

* This session falls into a series of sessions that you have already engaged in.  You started in Mod 1 week 5 with a viewing of the movie CODE in ordert to better understand the experiences of others in the tech world.  You have had multiple sessions on giving feedback and this is an additional tool that you can use to increase the effectiveness of your feedback. 
* This session is a space for us to reflect on the day to day conversations that we have with people, especially in context of teams and partner work.  Most conficts begin in day to day conversations, not in formal settings when we are giving feedback.  
* This session is going to provide a potential framework to communicate effectively while also considering perspective of other and the dynamics of power that we need to be conscious of when communicating.   
* Ultimately, meaningful communication is going to lead to better pairing, better team work, and better products.  

## Review Agenda

* Ice breaker and reflection
* NVC Framework
* Practice 
* Next Steps

## Ice breaker and reflection (10 min)

Stand up, find someone you have not spoken to in a while and answer these three questions

* What do you think mindful communication means and why is that important?
* Can you think of a recent conversation you were in or overheard where someone was not being “mindful”?
* What is challenging about being mindful when communicating?

While pairs are discussing, walk the room to pull from their discussions and select a few groups to share to the entire class.

Give the groups 5-6 minutes to share and then do a whole group share.  Some things that might come up:

	* It's hard to be mindful when we only have so many cognitive resources
	* It's hard to know what other people are feeling.  Why can't they just tell me?
	* We don't have time to be mindful.  We are always under deadlines. 
	
	
Highlight that these (and other) ideas will be addressed.  Move to slide 4 and highlight that we might not be great at mindful communication and their might seem to be barriers in our way (time, resources, etc); however, mindful communication is a SKILL that we can learn.  True growth mindset allows us to see mindful communication as something we are not great at, yet, but we can be if we focus on it.  Humans are not great at mindful communication.  We often revert or start by categorizing, judging, blaming, labeling, making comparisons.  That is how we have survived in the past and those things can help us make quick decisions.  However, these things that we are very good at also can cause us to jump to conclusions that distance us from what we want to actually achieve.  Last week you talked about active listening and the challenge of being fully present while at Turing.  It is impossible to be mindful of people's perspectives, potential power dynamics, or other issues if you are not fully present.  

## Nonviolent Communication Framework (5 min)

NVC was founded by Dr. Marshall Rosenberg, Ph.D.  He spend years researching effective and ineffective communication.  NVC is the integration of 4 major things:
*  Consciousness: empathy, care, courage, authenticity
*  Language:  Understanding how words can build connection or distance
*  Communication: Knowing how to ask and hear
*  Means of Influence: Sharing power rather than using power over others

This framework only works if we spend time doing a good amount of self reflection and if we save some of our cognitive resources to focus on how we are sharing or using our power over others.  This also requires us to think deeply about intent vs. impact.  If we do not have mindful communication, our impact might often miss our intent.  

## Observations (3 min)

* This is one of the hardest to do because we are very good making quick judgments of people.  
* Observations require thinking through the facts of what has happened, not your opinion of what happened
* This might mean being specific about actions that were taken such as not brainstorming outloud, being the only person who is making decisions on your code, talking over someone else, etc.

## Feelings (3 min)

* We, as a collective, are also not great (yet) at sharing feelings.  Using the word FEEL does not equal sharing FEELINGS. 
* Share examples on the slides to demonstrate how feel could be switched for think and the sentence still works
* SLIDE 12--Easy example of actual feeling words.  Disappointed, frustrated, sad, angry, are all feelings.

## Needs and Requests (5 min)

* These two are connected
* Make it easier on people by being clear about your needs and your request. This saves cognitive energy and resources.  
* If someone is not being clear (maybe they don't tell you what they are thinking or feeling) develop your skill of ASKING someone what they  need and what the potential solution might be.  Being frustrated that someone isn't sharing is not a good solution.  You can and should ask for a reflection.
* Consider your PRIVILEGE and POWER in the dynamic that you are in.  If you are in a space of power or privilge , extending a reflection is critical in order for you to SHARE power.  If you do not open the space, you can't share power. Most often people who are in a vulnerable space are less likely to openly communicate how they are doing.  So share the power and create better lines of communication.  
* This is especially true with NON-verbal communication.  Just saying "I'm not good at picking up cues from others, they should just tell me" isn't going to get you very far and isn't really practicing empathy.  If you are not sure, ask.  Continue to ask throughout the time you are working together.  It will help your partner improve and it will help your work get done more effectively. 
* Remember to consider your tone, body language, and eye contact when having these conversations.  This is extremely important to ensure you are being assertive and not passive, agressive, or passive agressive in this conversation.

## Practice (15 min)

For each of the slides, have students work with partners to re-phrase the examples given.  Give pairs 4-5 minutes with each example.  Then have a 2-3 minute whole group share.  Walk the room during the partnering to synthesize student reflections. 

## Reflection (5-8 min)

In your notebooks, please spend 5 minutes to reflect on these questions:

* What are you taking away from this session?
* Which part of the framework is most challenging for you?
* How do you think the NVC could help you demonstrate empathy and share power instead of over power?

This is a skill that requires you to practice and to save cognitive energy.  It requires a deep reflection of identity (working style, privileges, etc) and it requires you to take action.  Consider the NVC as a tool that you can use as a cohort to improve communication.
