#### Option 1: Cold Outreach
Start to meet others in the industry through informal research conversations. How do you meet them? Send them a cold outreach email and then set up a coffee meeting. To fulfill this deliverable, provide a synopsis of 6 cold outreach interactions following these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/cold_outreach_deliverable_guidelines.md) by **Monday of Week 5**

#### Option 2: Speak at a Meetup
Many Meetups are interested in having new people come speak to their communities, and beginner's tracks are the norm at many major Meetups. Contact the Meetup organizers, propose a talk idea (this can be about anything!), and get on their list. If you start to make this habit, organizers will begin to contact *you* when they need someone to fill in. This is a great opportunity to meet people and help out local meetups. To complete this deliverable, submit a gist by **Monday of Week 5** listing:  

* Which Meetup you spoke at/will be speaking at and why you chose that Meetup
* Your talk outline (1-2 paragraphs)
* 3-4 sentences on how you hope to utilize this talk to help you in your job search
 
It's okay if the Meetup hasn't happened by the deliverable deadline, but we'd like to see documentation that you've prepared to give this talk. 

#### Option 3: Write a Technical Blog Post and Promote it Through Your Network
If writing is more your style, you can choose to write a blog post about something you've learned during your time at Turing. In the blog post, we'll be looking to see:

* How you communicate technical details
* How you break down complicated processes into simple steps
* A desire to give back to the tech community
* A passion for learning and exploring new things

(Potential employers will be looking for those things as well)

One of the best places to post a technical post is [Medium](https://medium.com/). The audience reach is built in, and you're able to post to social media sites with ease. To complete the deliverable, include:

* Link to your blog post 
* 3-4 sentences on how you're using this blog post to connect with other people in your network (example: posting the blog post on Twitter and engaging in follow-up conversations there) in your PD submissions

Please submit a link to your blog post by **Monday of Week 5**

### Opening
In the last cold outreach session in Module Two, our focus was mostly on "warm outreach" as you used the mentorship network at Turing to start building relationships. But now we'll take the same principles from that session and apply them to creating relationships with people outside of the Turing community. 

**Whole Group Discussion:** What are the best practices? 

### Why Cold Outreach & Networking
When it comes to your job search, meeting people to have discussions about companies and experiences is much more effective than sending your resume out into the abyss. Creating opportunities to meet those people is where cold outreach and networking come in. The technology industry is a relatively small community, and networking is key to becoming a part of that community. 

### Option 1: Cold Outreach
**Whole Group Discussion:** When you're reaching out to people, what is your purpose? Hint: it's not to ask for a job. 

Suggested purposes:

* Research conversations 
* Tour office
* Hiring junior developers

Most common purpose: Research Conversations -- what is the purpose of these conversations? How can you approach this? 

Here are some [possible questions to ask](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11pkBWm3ZlN7disCY9T0Rg61ElwBzXgUf3VPuTRT05Zg/edit?usp=sharing)

#### How to Leverage Your Network
How can you leverage the network you already have? 

* Mentors: who does your mentor know who would be helpful to you? 
* Use your Trello Board: what companies are you researching? Who can you contact from those companies?
* LinkedIn: who works at companies that you're interested in?

#### Put the COLD in Cold Outreach
When creating a completely new relationship, here are some tips:

* No Turing/gSchool/HA alumni
* Try to avoid companies where alums are working
* Someone you've met but not worked with is OK
* Where are alumni already working? Here is a quick list (but not exhaustive) of companies that you should skip:

8th Light, Active Network, AdHawk, Advantage Integrated, Agilion, Allstate, American Thrombosis and Hemotosis Network, Aurigae, Blue Apron, Bonobos, Brandfolder, CA Technologies, Captain U, CareZone, Cirro, Coders Workshop, Cognizant Quick Left, CustomInk, DHR.net, Democracy Works, Digital Ocean, DispatchHealth, Ello, Equal Opportunity Schools, FanDuel Inc, Gitlab, Glassbreakers, GoSpotCheck, Gramercy Tech, Granicus, Guild Education, Harry Fox Agency (aka SESAC/Rumblefish), Huron, Impekable, Influx Data, Inquicker, Inspirato, Instacart, Invoca, Kite, Muve Health, NextRequest, Optum, Oracle, Politech, Procore, Real Geeks, Rumblefish, Shopify, Splice, Stitch Fix, TEKSystems, Tack Mobile, Tendril, Trelora, United Health Group, Vermont Public Radio, Vulk Coop, Wazee Digital, WellMatch/Aetna, Welltok Inc, Western Union, Wombat Security, eGauge Systems, iCentris, iTrellis

If you'd like to check any other company, feel free to DM Meg.

#### Do Some Research
What do you know about the person you're contacting? 

Find out where their interests lie. Read their Medium blog posts, sign up for their newsletters, and check out their websites. Some other resources:

* Research their projects on GitHub
* Find individuals on GitHub
* Look for community builders (events, sponsors, etc)
* Mine Meetup
* [Built in Colorado](http://www.builtincolorado.com/companies): find more companies
* [Slacklist](http://www.slacklist.info/) 
* [AngelList](https://angel.co/)
* [CrunchBase](https://www.crunchbase.com/#/home/index) 

You need to understand your contact's goals as much as you want them to know yours.

#### Finding Contact Info
Tools:

* [Email Hunter](https://emailhunter.co/)
* [Find That Lead](https://findthatlead.com/)
* [Find That Email](https://findthat.email/)
* [MatterMark](https://mattermark.com/)
* GitHub
* Personal website  

#### Crafting your Email
Develop a template to use. This will help you stay on script and get to the point.

1. Use the subject line: 

    * Short and real - lose the sales pitch
    * Relevant and personal
    * Consider how the snippet extends the subject line
    
    "Life at [amazing company]" 
    OR
    "Would like to connect"
    OR
    "Quick Question"
    
2. Greeting (simple, not overly formal). Make sure to spell their name right: 
    
    Hello [Name],
    
3. Body: 

    *Who am I? How did I find you? What do I want?*
    
    I'm a software developer in Denver about to graduate from the [Name of program] at Turing School of Software & Design. I found your contact info after researching education-focused startups in Denver. I'm interested in learning more about the work going on at [Company Name] and the Colorado startup scene in general. 
    
    *What interesting experience do I have that might make me worth meeting?*
    
    Before Turing, I taught in Denver Public Schools as a third and fourth grade teacher. 
    
    *Call to action*
    
    Could we grab coffee or get on the phone this week? How does this Wednesday at 4pm sound?
    
4. Closing (keep it simple):

      Thanks,
      
      [Your Name & contact info. Include your personal site if applicable]

Because you've researched your contact, you'll know if there are certain things you may have in common, such as:

* Fellow Bootcamp grad -- mention that you'd like to learn more about their transition from bootcamp to the tech industry
* Consider timing based on your research -- have they recently launched a new product? You could tie your message to events or activities that are top of mind to the recipient
* Connections -- even if you don’t know someone in common you may have some other connection, like a school or other organization

For more on the effectiveness of outreach and follow up, check out 1606-BE alum Jesse Spevack's [blog post on his job search experience](http://www.jessespevack.com/blog/2017/3/8/get-hired-how-i-went-from-bootcamp-grad-to-engineer)

#### What NOT to do
* Use an overly formal tone
* Write a lengthy email (less is more, longer emails won't be read)
* Spell their name or company name wrong
* Writing a generic email (make sure to tailor it accordingly)

### Practice & Group Feedback
Spend 10 minutes drafting an email to the person you've been researching. Be sure to include:

* Subject line
* Connection
* Call to action with a specific date and time

**Pair & Share:**
Form groups of 3-4 (4 max) and spend 10 minutes giving and receiving positive feedback and suggestions for improvement. Person A will read email and person B & C will both give:

* 1 specific piece of appreciative feedback
* 1 constructive recommendation for improvement

Reminder of guidelines for feedback conversations. Be specific, actionable, and kind! Here are examples:

* “I really like the way you circled back to the company mission!”
* “Your subject line does a great job of capturing the reader's attention!”
* “The personal connection about snowboarding was really clear!”
* "I wasn't quite sure what your connection was. Try out a few different phrases to get more specific."
* "I didn't hear a call to action. Provide a date and time to meet to make it easy for someone to respond."

“Good job buddy!” is *NOT* constructive feedback

### Follow Up
**What if they don't respond?**
If you don't receive a response, don't assume that means the conversation is dead. During busy weeks, emails can get lost. Send a follow-up email to say that you're still interested in meeting and suggest a new date/time. If you don't receive a response after that, move on to another contact.

If you receive a response saying they're too busy to meet that week or something similar, ask for a better time, and set up a meeting accordingly. Persistence pays off, and you're making it clear that meeting them is important to you. 

**What if they do respond?**
Use the meeting to build a relationship. 

Do:

* Ask questions -- ask about experience, projects, where they’d work next, what they’d change about their current role/team, advice for getting started in the industry
* Make eye contact
* Have your story ready to share
* Bring pen + paper, leave computer closed

Don't:

* Ask for a job
* Talk about yourself too much

### Option 2: Speaking at a Meetup

**Turn & Talk:** What Meetups have you gone to? How have they impacted your learning? How have you learned from other developers thus far in your tech career? 

Whole Group share-out

Chances are, you've learned from other developers' talks and own discoveries in their learning. With this option, you can join the community through giving back. Speaking at a meetup is a very effective way to impart knowledge, gain experience speaking, and provide your career with some exposure. 

#### How to Approach This
Pick a Meetup that you like

OR 

Pick a Meetup that sounds interesting


OR 

Look for kinds of topics have been covered at this Meetup recently -- how could you contribute?

#### Utilize Your Network
* Mentor Ian Douglas frequently includes Turing students and alumni as speakers at the Boulder Python meetup
* See what other meetups that Turing community members are involved in

#### Prepare Your Talk
A great way to approach your talk is to utilize the format of “here’s what I learned when I tried to _______." This is how you've learned from other developers and how they will learn from you.

Reach out to the organizers to find out their upcoming schedule and pitch your talk. Utilize the same cold outreach principles discussed above. 

#### Practice Time
Spend 10 minutes researching meetups and topics that you're interested in speaking on. Begin crafting an outline of a possible talk.

### Option 3: Writing a Technical Blog Post and Showing it Off
Why do developers write blogs? The biggest reason is to **build relationships.** Just as with open source projects, blog posts are another way to share knowledge and invite collaboration from others.

Writing a blog post about your experiences is a valuable way to share your knowledge and build your network. 

Here's how you can do it.

#### Template It Out: Decide What Your Post Is
Start with a template to help define your intent in writing *(adapted from emptysqua.re/blog post “Resources for Writing About Programming” by A. Jesse Jiryu Davis)*

**Disclaimer:** Your blog post does not have to fit into any of these templates. These are just suggestions. 

All of these have a clear opening, body, and closing. No matter how you choose to write your post, you should aim to structure your blog post in a similar fashion -- your reader needs structure to follow your thoughts. 

##### **Story:** 

"I'm going to tell you a story about [blank], how it taught me [blank], and led to [blank]. First this happened, then that happened. And that's the story of [blank]."

Examples:

* I did this project and learned this thing. I found out this thing about myself.
* I used this technology, and here’s what happened.
* I utilized agile practices in this way, and here's what happened. I learned this lesson. 

##### **Opinion:** 

Structure:

1. Thesis 
2. Evidence to support Thesis 
3. Response to likely objections
4. Restate Thesis

Focus on not only having an opinion but also crafting a compelling argument to support it.

Tip: Think about how your experience at Turing has shaped your opinion about how software is developed. 

##### **How-To:**

How-Tos must be motivated by something. Begin by telling your reader when and why this how-to is important to know.

“Doing [blank] is important under the given conditions: [blank]. I’m going to show you how to [blank]. Do this, then do that. There, now I’ve shown you how to [blank]. You should go out and do [blank].”

Hint: Any time you solve a problem, write about how you did it!

##### **How Something Works:**
There doesn’t need to be a clear motivation here other than what are you interested in learning?

When you’re trying to figure out how something works for a project or to describe a project management strategy that you are using in your project, writing an explanation of how it works is a good excuse to dive in and find out more.

“Do you wonder how [blank] works? I’m going to show you how [blank] is implemented. It does this and that. Now I’ve shown you how it works.”

##### **Review:**

Use reviews to describe and analyze instead of evaluating. It’s tempting to evaluate projects or processes on a good-bad axis, but this isn’t very useful. What is this thing *good for?*

“I used or implemented [blank]. This is what it is. This is what my experience was like. [Blank] has these strengths and weaknesses. In conclusion, it’s best when using these certain criteria to evaluate it.”

Now that you have a template, let's talk about the writing process.

### Writing Resources
Writing is like coding -- you have to practice at it. And just like with coding, you should utilize your resources to help you through the writing process:

* [Power Thesaurus](https://www.powerthesaurus.org/): Stuck on a word? Power Thesaurus is a crowdsourced tool that provides users with a ton of alternative word choices from a community of writers.
* [ZenPen](http://www.zenpen.io/): If you're having trouble staying focused, check out this distraction-free writing tool. ZenPen creates a minimalist "writing zone" that's designed to help you get words down without having to fuss with formatting right away.
* [Cliché Finder](http://cliche.theinfo.org/): Feeling like your writing might be coming off a little cheesy? Identify instances where you can be more specific using this handy cliché tool. 
* [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) -- Analyzes your sentence structures for readability and improvements.
* [Wordcounter.net](https://wordcounter.net/) -- In addition to counting your words, it also calculates reading time.
* [Here are more tools to help you with your writing](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/improving-writing-skills-tools#sm.000013b0c8ho5tdcez8pnsa14dbbn)

#### Utilize Peer Review 
The peer review process is similar to soliciting feedback on a project. As you draft your post, here are some tools to help you stay on top of revisions:

* [Start your draft on Medium](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214874698-Drafts)
* [Share with peers for review](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/215564177-Share-a-draft)
* [Peers can leave feedback through Notes](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214035868)

#### Use Your Network
Now that you have a blog post, you need people to read it! As mentioned above, Medium is an excellent platform to write your blog post on as it's easy to post to other forms of social media or back to your own personal site. 

### Your Turn
Spend 10 minutes choosing a format to write from and begin brainstorming a technical blog post. 

Make sure to solicit feedback from others as you craft this!

### Closing & Next Steps
Decide on a deliverable that you want to pursue, and you'll be expected to turn in one of these options on Monday of Week 5. 

Remember to document your cold outreach and networking opportunities in your Trello board -- this will also make it easier to fill out the deliverable guidelines when you've kept a record of what has happened.
