### Kick-Off
You've done the groundwork to prepare for your job search: refining your story, crafting your resume, building your portfolio. Now is the time to put all of these things into motion and talk about why you're the right person for the job. We started some practice on this last mod, and today, we're going to continue that practice in an informal interview workshop.

**Objectives:**
* Add to your interview preparation process
* Practice answering common behavioral interview questions
* Provide effective feedback for each other on responses
* Decide on an action step for how to improve your interview process

#### Interview Prep Tips
When answering an interview question, keep the acronym [STAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result) in mind:

* **Situation:** The interviewer wants you to present a recent challenge and situation in which you found yourself.
* **Task:** What were you required to achieve? The interviewer will be looking to see what you were trying to achieve from the situation. Some performance development methods use “Target” rather than “Task”. Job interview candidates who describe a “Target” they set themselves instead of an externally imposed “Task” emphasize their own intrinsic motivation to perform and to develop their performance.
* **Action:** What did you do? The interviewer will be looking for information on what you did, why you did it, and what the alternatives were.
* **Results:** What was the outcome of your actions? What did you achieve through your actions and did you meet your objectives? What did you learn from this experience and have you used this learning since?

**Other Tips:**
* Create a doc to keep track of technical concepts you're practicing, behavioral answers, and feedback
* Review:
  * Your professional story
  * Feedback you've received
  * Your projects; Go through your projects to reflect on:
    * One specific bug
    * Something that was really hard
    * Something that was rewarding
    * Any interesting struggles/insights about the collaboration process 
  * Your Flower Exercise
  * Your strengths
  * Your areas of growth
  * DTR Memos
  * Retro notes
  * Eval notes
* Utilize your resources:

During each person's response, takes notes in your notebook about what you hear:
* What do you like about the answer?
* What would you do differently? 

### Debrief
Now that you've had time to practice, go over the feedback you've received to identify one action step you can take away from today's this experience to continue to work on.

* Whole Group Share-out
