## Visioning, Barriers, & Strengths
### Embarking on the Mod 4 Job Search: Dream Big
Close your eyes and imagine that you’re in your dream job; what is it like? What are you doing? What does the company do? Who do you work with? Who are your users? Why is this a dream job for you — do you get to do what you like? Are you using your strengths? Do you get mentorship?

Now open your eyes. Is there anything standing in your way of achieving that dream? 

### (Perceived) Barriers to your Job Search
We can sometimes talk ourselves out of opportunities before we even give them a chance, and we create our own barriers to success.

* Examples of barriers:
	* "I talk myself out of applying to certain jobs because I don’t meet enough of the listed qualifications."
*This is common among women.*
	* "I don’t feel comfortable networking. It feels forced, and I don’t want to do something that doesn’t feel genuine, so I stay home from meet-ups."
	* "Interviews make me really nervous, so I end up performing badly. It’s hard for me to code or communicate on the spot."
	* "I just want a job." When you don't clarify what you want, it can cause your job search to meander, and this could be a barrier for what you really want. 

What are some barriers you might carry with you? Think about these areas:

* Entering the Software Industry
* Outreach
* Networking
* Interviewing (either technical or culture-based questions)
* Personal Branding for yourself
* Balancing the workload of Module 4 and the job search
* Other -- what other anxieties do you have that aren't covered in the other categories? 

**You Do:**
Individually, reflect in your journal on specific barriers that have come up for you in previous job searches and/or that you anticipate could hold you back in your current job search: 

* Why do you think these barriers occur for you? 
* Have you tried to overcome them in the past? If so, what was effective for you? 
* Think about how you answered the "confidence in the job search" question in the survey for PD peer groups. What specific areas bring you confidence? What areas do you feel less confident in?
* What kind of support could you use from your peer group to help you move past these barriers? 
* Now that you have named any potential obstacles and how you will move past them, think about where you want to go in your job search this module. 

### Goal-Planning: Get that Dream Job
Now that you’ve named potential obstacles, you can begin to work past them. Start by thinking back to that dream job and creating concrete goals to get it. Reflect in your journal on these questions:

* What feels doable during this module to move forward in your job search? What would be a stretch?
* Write out 3 SMART goals that you will work towards in your job search this module
	* SMART = Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
* What is 1 action step you will take in the next week to help you make progress towards achieving your goals? 

## Group Discussion
Now with your group, discuss at least one barrier that came to mind in your reflection, how you hope to overcome it, and what support you need from your group to do so.
 
 * What is one action step you will take in the next week to help you realize your goals?
 * How will you hold each other accountable in this group?
 
 Start a Slack channel for your group and post your action steps in it.
 
 **Whole Group Share-Out:**
 At least one person from each group will share out an action step that they are taking or how the group will hold each other accountable

## Work Time: Start on your Action Steps!
In these 10 minutes, you could:

* Send at least 1 outreach email
* Block out time on your calendar for all job-related things this module
* Schedule a mock interview with a mentor or Ian
* Start revising your resume
* Update your LinkedIn
* Start on a cover letter
* Ask for feedback on something from your coach or fellow group members

### Closing: Discuss Next Steps & Homework

* Status updates on your action steps
* 1 helpful tip for someone else in your group
* Tailored resume for 1 position
* Tailored cover letter for same position
