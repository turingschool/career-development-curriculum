# Your Final PD Deliverable
## The Post-Grad Job Search Action Plan Template

### Directions
Follow these submission guidelines and include answers to Step 1 and Step 2 in a private gist that you should submit in a DM along with a PDF of your up-to-date resume to Kayt (@kayt) by Monday of Week 6 at 9am 

### Step 1: Create a Calendar
The job search is now your full-time job, and in order to stay on top of it, structuring your time well is key. Just as you've done in Mod 4, please build out a calendar to structure your time reflecting your full-time job search. 

#### How To Do This:
Build a sustainable routine:
  * What will a typical week look like for you? 
  * What is a realistic way to spend your time? 
  * When do you work best during the day? 

#### For Example:
* 7-9am: Wake up, breakfast, etc.
* 9-10am: Complete CodeWars exercise
* 10-11am: Research postings and companies
* 11am-11:30am: Create a task list to complete for a posting, put in Huntr
* 11:30am-12pm: Write an outreach email and outline cover letter
* 12-1pm: Lunch
* 1-2pm: Finish cover letter
* 2-3pm: Break
* 3-4pm: Coffee Meeting
* 4-5pm: Gym/walk outside
* 5-7pm: Attend meetup
* 7-8pm: Dinner with friends/family
* 8-10pm: Free time/down time
* 10pm: Bed time

**What to Submit:**
* Include a screenshot of your first week post-graduation (Turing intermission week) calendar in your gist by following [these directions](https://gist.github.com/kannankumar/4c613cac6d9db896062a16e1cc57d3e5)
* This screenshot again should have all of your job search time broken down into specific tasks

### Step 2: Help Us Help You
Please answer the following questions so that Kayt and the rest of the post-grad support staff can most effectively help you in your job search:

1. What motivates you?

2. How will you keep yourself going when faced with rejection in the job search?

3. How will you hold yourself accountable to your plans? (Ex: Attend Mod 5, meet with cohortmates, attend Kayt's coffee shop hours, etc.)

4. How do you like to communicate?

5. What is your ideal job? 

6. What has been your approach to the job search so far?

7. What could you use help with?

8. Anything else you'd like Kayt to know?

9. If you are not using Huntr, please include a link here to the job tracker you're using so that Kayt can follow along with your progress. 

### Step 3: Send Your Latest Resume to Kayt
Send a PDF of your resume to Kayt in your DM with your gist answering the above questions. Make sure your resume is titled appropriately, e.g. 'FirsNameLastName.pdf'.
