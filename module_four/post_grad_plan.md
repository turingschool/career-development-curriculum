# Post-Grad Job Search Action Plan Template: Your first 30 Days
You are so close! You've spent the last 7 months working towards this -- graduation and finding your new dream job! This plan is meant to help you streamline your goals and get on the path to employment as a software developer during the first 30 days after graduation. **Please fill out the plan by copying this template into a gist to submit in your portfolio.** 

As you fill out this plan, consider how your first job search will set the tone for your career trajectory in the software industry. After all, your first developer job should align with those goals as well so that you're on track for a longterm successful career. 

**Note:** If you have already secured a job prior to graduation, skip to the second part of the plan below.  

## #1: 30-Day Job Search Action Plan
### Create a schedule & goals for the first 30 days Post-Graduation
Design a 40-hour "work week" that provides time for: 
* Code (ideally, 2-4 hours a day will be dedicated to coding)
* Outreach & Networking
* Job & company research and tracking
* Interview Prep
* Housekeeping (refining your professional story, updating your resume, writing cover letters, updating your Turing portfolio, updating your LinkedIn profile)
* Other (social networking, blogging, planning talks, etc.)
* Check-ins: who are you talking to and when?

How much time will you spend on each? When will you do each thing?

**Action Step #1:** Establish a shareable calendar (like Google Calendar) and block out time on your calendar *now* to adhere to these goals. Be prepared to show this calendar to your instructors during your portfolio review.

**Action Step #2:** Backwards plan for your big goal. What is your cut-off for ending the job search? When do you want to receive and sign an offer by?


**Action Step #3:** Based on what you outlined above, create monthly, weekly, and daily goals to reach in order to reach your big goal:


Keep in mind:

* What is feasible in your schedule?
* What actions will give you the most impact in your search?

### Coding
For time spent coding during your first 30 days post-grad, consider: 
* What skills would you like to improve or develop? 
* Are there areas from Turing's program that you feel weaker in? How will you level up? 
* Are there new languages or technologies you'd like to learn? How and when will you do that?

**Action Step:** Establish a “daily-practice” repository where you’ll put small daily exercises or work on issues from your own projects that you want to update to keep your skills sharp and your GitHub activity chart active. For your Mod 4 portfolio review, be prepared to describe to your instructors what you plan to work on to sharpen and advance your coding skills for the first 30 days of your job search. 

### Outreach & Networking
As we've discussed, meeting people, forming relationships, and having conversations are the key pieces to getting your foot in the door at any company. It's important to be proactive in your approach to outreach and networking to stay on track during your first 30 days.

**Action Step #1:** Identify at least 3 individuals from companies you're tracking who could connect with during your first 30 days. Describe why you want to connect with these people and what you hope to talk about, when you will email them by, and what your follow-up will look like once you've met with them. 

**Action Step #2:** Find 3 new meetups or other career networking events to join during your first 30 days post-grad and describe why you'll attend those particular events. How will attending these meetups benefit you in your job search? How can you contribute to the community of these meetups? If you're interested in speaking at any of these meetups, describe how you'll connect with the organizers to arrange that and give a brief (2-3 sentences) pitch on what you might talk about and why. 

### Job/Company Research & Tracking
Success in the job search means staying organized. The best way to do that is to have a clear system to keep track of your contacts, research, and updates on what you're doing. 

**Action Step:** Show how you've set up [jobtrack.io](https://jobtrack.io/) to keep track of all your company/job outreach, who you talked to, what you learned, what next steps you'll take to follow-up, and anything you might do differently next time. Be prepared to describe this system to your instructors during your portfolio review. 

### Interview Prep
During this module, you've had multiple opportunities to practice your technical and cultural interviewing skills. Think about how those experiences have helped you identify strengths and weaknesses in your interviewing skills.

**Action Step:** Identify 2-3 areas you'd like to continue to improve on for interviewing and outline concrete action steps on how you will improve those skills. If you plan on setting up more mock interviews, identify who you will set those up with and by what date. 

### Housekeeping
Make sure you have all your job search components up-to-date and looking their best!

**Action Step #1:** Ensure your [Turing Portfolio](http://turing.io/alumni) has **at least 3 projects displayed,** including your latest work, and an accurate list of your desired locations. Be prepared to show this to your instructors during your M4 portfolio review. 

**Action Step #2:** Ensure your LinkedIn is up to date and indicates that you’re job hunting. Indicate here a summary of any adjustments you made and how you'll continue to update it and/or use the site to build your network and online presence. 

### Other
What other areas would you like to focus on during your job search? Some possible ideas include:
* Social Networking
* Blogging
* Planning and submitting meetup and/or conference talks
* Participating in hackathons or open source projects

**Action Step:** Identify one of the areas above or an additional area that you'd like to develop further during your first 30 days post-grad and be prepared to discuss this with your instructors at your portfolio review. 

### Check-ins: Who are you talking to and when?
Accountability is key during a job search and being able to check in with a person whom you trust (or, ideally, more than one person) on your progress will increase your ability to reach your goals in the timeline you've created. 

**Action Step:** Identify 1-2 people you'll check in with during your first 30 days post-grad. Consider how you might continue to utilize your PD Peer Groups. Describe why you will check in with this person, how you will check in with them, what you aim to talk about, and what you hope to get out of these check-ins to benefit your job search. 

### Identifying & Overcoming Barriers
While you've made concrete plans for how to achieve your goal, it's also important to take stock of what could hold you back in the job search. 

**Action Step:** Identify 1-2 "barriers" you might put on yourself in this job search as well as the steps you will take to overcome them. Be prepared to describe these in your M4 portfolio review. 

## #2: Supporting Others in Your Cohort in Their Job Search
*Fill out this part only if you have already secured a job prior to graduation.*

As a member of the Turing community, your support in the job search makes a big difference for your peers as they pursue their first position. Complete the following action steps to 

**Action Step #1:** Identify 1-2 people from your PD Peer Group who you will continue to check in with during the first 30 days post-graduation. Describe what you will do in these check-ins, how you will help keep them motivated, and how you will follow up with these cohortmates afterwards.

**Action Step #2:** With the person(s) you identified above, describe one area of the job search that you feel particularly skilled in and will commit to helping them with on a regular basis during the first 30 days. Examples include: review outreach emails, review blog posts, practice storytelling, attend meetups or other events with them, etc. Why do you feel that you can help in this area? What will your help look like?

**Action Step #3:** Utilize your networking experience in the job search to recommend 1-2 people whom you've met that others in your cohort would benefit from meeting as well. Describe how you will make the introductions for at least 1 person in your cohort and when you will execute this by. 

## #3: Post-Grad Plans & Action Steps
In this section, you'll find action steps that you should aim to complete during your first 30 days post-grad, but these are not steps that you need to have completed for your portfolio review. Instead, you should begin thinking about how you will achieve these steps, and your post-grad job search support coach will ask about progress on these during that first 30 days. 

**Scheduling Post-Grad Action Step:** At the end of each week during your first 30 days, assess what worked with the schedule and what didn't so that you can make adjustments as needed and manage your time even more effectively for the following week. This will also help you keep a record of what you've done in your job search. 

**Outreach Post-Grad Action Step:** During the first 30 days, you should aim to reach out to at least 10 individuals. Even if you don't have a list of all 10 for the draft of this plan for portfolio review, be prepared to meet this target during your first 30 days of the job search. 

**Job/Company Research & Tracking Post-Grad Action Step:** Reach out to and apply to at least 10 companies/jobs.

**Housekeeping Post-Grad Action Step #1:** During this timeframe, you should establish a “master” resume that you’ll customize per employer. You should already have a working version that you submitted in Module 3. 

**Housekeeping Post-Grad Action Step #2:** Establish a “master” cover letter with your key talking points that you'll customize per employer.
