# Application for Job Search Mentorship Program
In order to apply for the Mod 4 Job Search Mentorship Program, submit a private gist containing information for Sections I & II [here](https://forms.gle/oeRiiGGg9naMeqPV6) by 4pm on Monday of Week 2. This application should take you about 30-60 mins total. 

## Section I: Calendar
To balance your job search with your Mod 4 workload, structuring your time well is key. Using a program like Google Calendar, build out a calendar for Week 3 to show how you will spend time outside of class on your job search. Your job search timeboxing should be as specific as you can make it. 

#### How To Do This:
Build a sustainable routine:
  * What could a typical week look like for you?
  * When do you work best during the day? 
  * What is a realistic way to spend your time? (Don't overcommit yourself; consider blocking out 1 hour a day or a few times a week)
  * What will you work on during that time?
  
**What to Submit:**
* Include a screenshot of your Week 3 calendar in your gist by following [these directions](https://gist.github.com/kannankumar/4c613cac6d9db896062a16e1cc57d3e5)
* This screenshot should have all of your job search time broken down into specific tasks (i.e., find posting, write outreach email, write cover letter, etc.)

## Section II: Short Answer Responses
Please respond to these questions: 

1. Why do you want mentoring in the job search?

2. How will you hold yourself accountable to balancing time for your job search and following your mentor and group's advice?

3. What is the focus of your job search (timeline, ideal job, steps you’ve already taken)? Be as specific as you can.

Add your responses to your application gist.

## Section III: Turing Alumni Portfolio
Your [alumni portfolio](https://alumni.turing.io/) should have all fields filled out and include at least 3 projects. Portfolios considered most effective will:

* Provide a strong sense of one's professional interests through the summary
* Provide a strong sense of one's abilities as a software developer through detailed project descriptions
* Demonstrate attention to detail (no typos, all links work correctly, project ReadMes are detailed, etc.)

## Section IV: Resume
The version of your resume that is on your Turing Alumni Portfolio is what will be considered for the application. 

## Section V: Mod 4 First Solo Project
The effort put into your first Module 4 project is taken into account as a component of exceptional professionalism.
