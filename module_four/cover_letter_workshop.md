    * Here's how this job/company fits into my passions and story
    * Here are details about why I'd be a great fit for this job
* Create a connection between you and the job/company
    * I understand the needs of your company and the kind of work you do

#### Frequently Made Mistakes in Cover Letters

**Mistake:** Very long/wordy cover letters. **Solution:** Shorter paragraphs to be easily skimmable; Cut out extraneous details 

**Mistake:** Cover letter is all about you. **Solution:** Only talk about yourself in the context of this job and company to demonstrate how you will provide value. Don’t talk about what you’re hoping to **get** from the company (i.e., mentorship, culture, etc.). The letter should be all about what you’re going to **give** the company as an employee.

**Mistake:** Grammar and spelling errors. **Solution:** Use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) or the [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)

## Cover Letter Reviews
In your PD groups, follow this format:

### Individual Review
Students: Take 5 minutes to go through the [Cover Letter Checklist](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/cover_letter_checklist.md) and reread the cover letter to decide what feedback will be most valuable during the review. To figure out what feedback will be most valuable for you, think about these questions:
   * What are you not sure about?
   * What would you like to do differently but you don't know how?

### Group Feedback
Now going around the group, each person will:
   * Share a brief overview of the company and position for which they're applying; share the link to the position if able
   * Share what kind of feedback they're most interested in
   * Read the cover letter out loud to the group
Group and Coach will give feedback using these questions:
   * What's your snap impression?
   * What's most memorable?
   * What's repetitive? 
   * What makes this person a good fit for the position?
   * What do you have questions about?
Each person should get about 10 minutes for their feedback

### Revision Time
Using the feedback you received, revise your letter and decide on next steps for this application:

* Who will you reach out to from the company? Or how will you do research to figure out the right person to reach out to?
* What other pieces need to be completed for this application?
* Do you need any other feedback/support before submitting this application?
* By what exact date/time will you submit this application?
