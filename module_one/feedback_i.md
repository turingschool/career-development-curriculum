### Facilitator Instructions
There are facilitator notes throughout this markdown to divide up responsibilities in the session, assuming there are 2 instructors (1 BE and 1 FE) in the session. Please read through this markdown ahead of the session, decide who is going to be Facilitator #1 and who will be Facilitator #2, and let Allison know if you have any questions.

### Session Structure

Length: 60 mins

**Facilitator #1:** Using slides #3-13, go through the following:

**Slide #3:**

* Opening (15 mins)
* Kinds of Feedback (15 mins)
* Intent vs. Impact & Blind Spots (15 mins)
* Feedback Frameworks (10 mins)
* Example (5 mins)

### Objectives
**Slide #4:**

* Understand and recognize the three triggers of feedback
* Define and understand the 3 different kinds of feedback
* Analyze intent vs. impact, blind spots, and biases
* Use specific, actionable, and kind principles to deliver meaningful feedback

### Deliverable

You will submit feedback for your paired project partners this module by sending a paragraph of written feedback intended for your partner in a survey. Your feedback will be reviewed and you may be asked to update the feedback before it is passed on to your partner. Feedback will also be shared with your instructors. 

#### Opening
**Slide #5:**

Why are we talking about this? 

The benefits of giving and receiving feedback well include:

* Increased learning and improvements
* Other people find it more enjoyable to work with you
* Easier to collaborate with others to solve problems
* You can set an example to help others see the value in seeking feedback for themselves

**Slide #7:**

**Personal Reflection:**

Think of a couple of pieces of feedback in the recent past that you found tough to receive:

* What were the most immediate thoughts to go through your mind as you received this feedback? 
* How would you describe your experience in relation to the three triggers (truth, relationship, identity)? 
* Which of the three triggers do you find most perplexing and why? 
* What might help you manage these triggers?

**Turn & Talk:** Share your experience with a partner

**Slide #8:**

Recap the 3 triggers as a whole group:

* Truth
* Relationship
* Identity 

**Slides #9-12:**

### Three Kinds of Feedback
In order to better recognize our triggers, we need to first understand what kind of feedback we're hearing

* **Appreciation** is giving thanks to your partner and encouraging your partner to keep doing what they're doing well. 
	* To be effective: 
		* Specific
		* Authentic
		* Delivered in a form that works for you
* **Coaching** is discussing a better way to do something to help you grow. Coaching can be related to improving your skills or at fixing a perceived imbalance in a relationship.
	* To be effective:
		* Listening
		* Asking questions
* **Evaluation** is telling your partner where they stand compared to a standard or compared to others. Evaluation aligns expectations and clarifies consequences. 
	* To be effective:
		* Be clear the standards or expectations to evaluate against
		* Aligns expectations and informs decision making

**Slide #13:**

#### Examples - which type of feedback is this?
**Note to Facilitator #1:** You can either cold call on students in the whole group or have them discuss the examples in pairs and then give responses. In each example, there could be triggers; ask the students, "If you received this feedback, how would you feel? What assumptions are being made here?" 

* "I admire how you jumped into discussing our Git workflow. I was feeling lost about that, and you helped me understand it more because you took the time to explain what you were doing."

* "I would have liked to hear your ideas more. It seemed like you were hesitant to share them with me and questioned yourself a lot. I think the initial brainstorming phase would be a good time to share your ideas so that you can test them out or spend time explaining them in a lower stakes environment."

* "Compared to the last time we paired together, I noticed that you were debugging errors more quickly this time around. I can see that you've been spending time going through the docs, and I appreciate how much more efficient that made our worktime." 

#### Tips:

* Ask for the type of feedback you want
* At Turing, you should give and receive appreciation and coaching

Here's more on why feedback can create triggers...

**Facilitator #2:** Using slides #15-27, go through the following:

**Slide #15:**

### Intention vs. Impact 
Every dialogue includes *intent* and *impact*. The intent (the purpose behind the giver's message) may not always align with its impact (how the receiver is affected by the message) in conversation. The way we are impacted by feedback can correspond with one of the three triggers. 

For example:

| Feedback | Giver's Intent | Giver's Impact |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| I think you should work on being more confident | When you don't know something, be confident enough to admit it. | You come across as doubtful or passive; instead, you should give others the impression that you have all the answers. Be a phony. |

**Facilitator asks from the whole group:**

* What kind of feedback is this?
* How does this relate to a trigger? What other impacts might this message have?
* We're thinking about this feedback knowing what the impact is already. How can you be more aware of impact while phrasing your feedback?

**Slide #16:**

### Blind Spots
Blind spots are always present as a gap between the self we think we present and the self that others see. Even with good intentions, your thoughts and feelings can affect the impact of your communication through behaviors that you don't always notice. These can include:

* Your facial expressions
* Your tone of voice
* Your behavior patterns

**Facilitator asks from the whole group:**

* How could blind spots potentially affect the intent of a feedback giver's words?
* What blind spots should we be aware of when we're providing written feedback? 

Examples might include: lack of tone of voice, misunderstandings of emphasis on certain words, lack of facial expressions

**Slide #17:**

#### Blind Spots lead to Biases

* A bias is a feeling either favorable or negative towards others based on a narrowed viewpoint. We often feel positive bias towards others who are most like us and negative bias against others who are different from us
* We may be more likely to not give constructive feedback to people who are similar to us
* Or we may be over critical of people for whom we already have a bias.

**Slide #18:**

#### Turn & Talk:
Discuss these examples with your partner:

| Feedback | Giver's Intent | Giver's Impact |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| I think the project went fine overall. But I think you should work on your organization skills. You were late to most meetings. | The project got finished, but my partner should know that tardiness is affecting their pairing abilities | This is so harsh. Didn’t I do anything right? |
| You're making a lot of strides with TDD. You got a 3 on testing again this project | Few people ever get a 4, and you got a 3 twice in a row. This is impressive! | I worked even harder than last project, and I still got a 4. This instructor is too hard on me. |

**Facilitator:** Cold call on 1 group for each example to share what they discussed.

**Slide #20:**

### Being Intentional in Giving Feedback: So Many Frameworks!
In [Learning to Pair](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md), we discussed the Crucial Conversations framework, which is mean to establish safety and respect in your conversation by establishing:

* Facts
* Feelings
* Dialogue: ask for the other person's position

Feedback conversations can follow a similar framework. When thinking about what feedback to give your partner, stick to these principles:

* Make it **specific**
* Make it **actionable**
* Make it **kind**

Now, how can you actually do that? Similar to using Crucial Conversations, the Situation-Behavior-Impact framework can help you clarify the feedback you need to deliver. 

The [Center for Creative Leadership](https://www.ccl.org/) developed the SBI Feedback tool to help managers deliver clear, specific feedback. You can apply it to your partnerships at Turing too!

**Slide #21:**

* **Situation:** When you're giving feedback, first define the when and where of the situation you're referring to. This puts the feedback into context, and gives the other person a specific setting as a reference.
	* "During work time yesterday, when you completed that feature..."
	* "At the check-in with the instructor on Monday afternoon..."

**Slide #22-23:**

* **Behavior:** Your next step is to describe the specific behaviors that you want to address. This is the most challenging part of the process, because you must communicate *only* the behaviors that you observed directly. You must not make assumptions or subjective judgments about those behaviors. These could be wrong, which could cause a truth trigger and undermine your feedback.
	* "During work time yesterday, when you completed that feature, you did not ask me to review your PR before pushing your code. We had written in our DTR memo that we would review each other's code as part of our workflow."
	* "At the check-in with the instructor on Monday afternoon, I saw you point out the code that I wrote, and you mentioned that you learned a lot from it."

**Slide #24-25:**

* **Impact:** The last step is to describe the impact that the behavior had on you and the project. Try to use "I" statements when referring to yourself. As you discuss the impact, make it actionable for what your team member could do to change or build on the behavior for the future. 
	* "During work time yesterday, when you completed that feature, you did not ask me to review your PR before pushing your code. We had written in our DTR memo that we would review each other's code as part of our workflow. I'm concerned that not taking time to review our code could result in more bugs. I also wish I could've learned more about the code from reviewing it."
	* "At the check-in with the instructor on Monday afternoon, I saw you point out the code that I wrote, and you mentioned that you learned a lot from it. I really appreciate that you took the time to acknowledge what I did, and I'm glad I was able to help you learn too." 
	
**Slide #26:**

Again, a framework can be helpful when you are trying to figure out what feedback to give and how to give it.

**Slide #27:**

Other guiding principles for deciding on what feedback to give:
* What feedback will be helpful for my partner's learning and coding career? 
* What should my partner consider when working with someone like me in the future? 
* What should my partner consider when working with someone who is different from me in the future? 
* How could my partner build on what they're doing well?

**Facilitator #1:** Using Slides #29-31, go through the following:

**Slide #29:**

### Example of Written Feedback

> Thank you for your contributions, especially in styling of several of our pages in the last few days. The site presentation looks much better as a result. Thank you also for checking in with me before you began working on a new item. I know that you didn’t always feel strong with some of the more complex aspects of our project, and I think that may have caused you to communicate with me less. I feel like there were several times during the project where either you had a missing DB migration or merge conflicts due to working off a branch with a head far behind our current dev_branch. I would suggest that you communicate with your future pairs more often to help avoid these issues. Committing and submitting PR's more often, even if it means smaller steps, would also help resolve merge conflicts along the way rather than letting them build into massive problems that take away from project time. In the last two days of the project, I feel like your contributions improved tremendously, and I very much appreciated the work you did.

**Facilitator asks from the whole group:**

* What do you notice about this feedback? 
* What's working well? 
* What assumptions are being made here? What would trigger you if you received this feedback? 
* What would you change? 

**Note to Facilitator:** There often isn't time for work time in the session, so use the following (Slide #30) only if there's time; otherwise, skip to Slide #31

### You Do: Work Time 
Write out your feedback for your project partner

Keep in mind:

* What should you be aware of? 
* How does your tone sound?
* Remember that we're all trying to help each other -- how can you give feedback that will be most meaningful for your partner's growth?

**Slide #31:**

### Closing
* Your deliverable is to submit your appreciation and coaching feedback for your partner by Monday of Week 4 at 9am using the survey posted in your cohort Slack channel.
