### Pre-Reading

Read the following [article](https://www.fastcompany.com/3016031/leadership-now/are-you-an-introvert-or-an-extrovert-and-what-it-means-for-your-career) in preparation for this session.

**Note:** If the reading was sent to students beforehand, have them complete the growth mindset recap; if it wasn't, have them read the article in the session and skip the growth mindset recap. The reading takes about 10 minutes. 

### Introduction (2 minutes)
You have started to work together in meaningful ways--during class, in pairing sessions, and in partner projects.  That means that we are 100% certain you are about to experience (or already have) a clash in working styles.  If we can discuss how we learn and work best, we can think about ways that we can better communicate our needs AND compromise in order to bring out the best in everyone.  Today we are going to start with a quick growth mindset reflection and then dig into understanding the spectrum of workstyles we have in our cohorts. 

Learning Goals:

* Continue the conversation about growth mindset
* Build self-awareness so that you can develop even more empathy with others
* Understand how we can leverage our different working styles for success at Turing and beyond

### Individual Reflection - Growth Mindset (3 minutes)

Reflect on the following questions in your notebook.

* Where have you been successful in maintaining a growth mindset?
* Where have you been challenged in maintaining a growth mindset?
* What new strategies have you identified to help you strengthen your growth mindset?

### Pair Share (3 minutes)

Turn to a pair and share how you've been successful this week in maintaining a growth mindset.

### Working Styles & Preferences (5 minutes)

* Facilitator: Set up a space in the room where students can line up.  The two ends are introversion and extroversion.  Ambiverts would line up in the middle.  
We are going to line up based on a scale of introversion to extroversion while we are here at Turing. Many times you can say that your intro/extro/ambiversion might depend on the situation.  In this case, we want you to select the place on the spectrum that you are most often in while you are at Turing.  Think about your reactions in class, how you respond to pairing, how you work in group projects.  
* Facilitator:  Model where you would go on the spectrum based on your own experiences.  
Based on where students are standing, find a group of 3-4 (no more than 4) people who are standing close to where you identified on the spectrum.  Find your group and move to a section of the room where you can be comfortable. Instruct students to take a piece of chart paper and marker with them to record their group's answers. 

### Small Group Discussion # 1 (15 minutes)

Before you begin discussing the questions below, ensure that the following roles are delegated to members of your group.

| Role | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| **Timekeeper** | Ensure that the group has a chance to address all the discussion questions and time at the end to complete the survey.|
| **Facilitator** | Works with the timekeeper to move through the discussion questions. Solicits input from all members of the group and helps individuals be aware if they are dominating the conversation.|
| **Writer** | Writes down ideas from the group on the chart paper provided. Label the chart paper with what kind of group you identify as. |
| **Participant (all)** | Listens actively, is respectful and engaged, takes responsibility for all members having a chance to share their perspectives and learn from others.  Everyone should take notes in your notebook so that you can share in your second group. |

Students will discuss these questions and create a chart on their paper of their strengths and challenges:

* What are your strengths in regards to this working style?
* What challenges have you faced because you identify with this working style? Think about challenges in pairing, in class, in community activities.
* How do you think you're perceived by those who don't share this same working style?
* What do you need from other working styles to be at your best?

* Facilitator: Give students a 5 minute warning and ensure that they have made it to the last question.

### Gallery Walk (5 minutes)

Students walk around the room to read what's been written on the various charts. They should note any new ideas or perspectives they want to remember. 

### Small Group Discussion # 2 (10 minutes)

* Facilitator:  Ask students who feel like they are more extroverted to raise their hands.  With hands raised, ask two extroverts to find two introverts (people with their hands down) and form new groups.  Ambiverts should break into different groups so they are with people from across the spectrum.  

In your new groups, discuss these questions. Everyone should have a chance to share without interruption.  

* Share your dominant working style and what came up in your first discussion
* What do you need from other working styles to be at your best?
* What are some of the differences between working styles that cause conflict?
* How could you address the differences in your work?

## Whole Group Share (5 min)
* Ask for some reflections from a few different groups.  

### Individual Reflection (3 minutes)
In your notebook, please respond to these two questions.

* What did you hear from people who were opposite ends of the spectrum from you?  What would it require for you to give someone else what they needed to be at their best? 
* How can you leverage your place on the spectrum of introversion/extroversion to impact your career in the future?

### Closing (2 minutes)

Take your individual reflections to cohort retro and share the action steps or reflections you had today.
