# Strengths & Storytelling Reflection #2 Guidelines  

Build on your professional story by thinking about how you're progressing at Turing. Answer the questions below in your own gist to use your StrengthsFinder themes to add to your story:

* Think back to last module compared to this module:
  * How have you changed? 
  * How have your strengths helped you with your progress? 
  * Where are you stronger now than on day 1 of last module? 
  Think about your progress both in terms of your technical and professional strengths.

* Even though your Turing story isn't finished yet, what do you envision for your development in future mods? How do you want to continue to build your role at Turing? How will this story end?
