# Career Journal Template - 2005 Cohort

## Overview
* **What is a career journal?** The journal will help guide you through the process of discovering who you are as a new developer and how that translates into your career goals.  It’s a way to check in with yourself through self-reflection, prompts, and questions, organize your targeted job search, and remember who you met as you build a professional network.   
* **Make it your own.** Add questions and areas to reflect on each week. Just don’t forget to share all of your successes and achievements along the way! 
* **Ongoing progress checks.** Throughout the module, you'll respond to the other prompts and update your progress in your document during professional development workshops and set aside work time. 
* **Module Expectations.** A completed career journal is required for successfully passing Module 3. The career development team will be assessing your progress throughout the module, and you will submit it for final review in week 6. You will also include highlights from your progress in your end of module portfolio presentation. 

### Directions
1. Copy the following into your own gist or Google Doc. You'll be sharing this with the Career Development Team. 
2. At the end of week 1, you'll submit the link to your journal in a survey provided to you by Allison. Please DM her with any questions you have. 

### Mod 1 Week 1: Understanding your strengths 
1. Describe one of your strengths
* What is something you have learned to do well (list a skill)?
* What is something you know about (list some knowledge/expertise you have)?
* What is something you have a natural ability to do well (list a talent)?
* How do those combine to create a specific strength?

2. Read through your Top 4 results from Pairin
* In your own words, what do these top 4 qualities tell you about yourself?
* Do they resonate with you? Why/why not?
* How do they relate to the strength you wrote about in Prompt #1?

3. Challenges with strengths
* What can make it challenging to recognize your strengths? How can you work through those challenges?
* Do you ever see yourself overusing certain strengths? In what circumstances would you want to use them less and amplify other strengths? How could you adjust your approach in those instances?

4. Strengths in action
* Write 1-2 sentences describing how you like to work (i.e., Do you pre-plan? Do you talk through your ideas first? Do you work better with deadlines? How do you stay organized?)
* How could you talk about these working preferences with your project teammates? Your mentor? Your instructors?
* What would you need to be aware of when working with people who have different strengths from you?
* How could your Pairin results help you better understand your everyday working preferences?

5. Continued growth
* Is there any particular strength you'd like to sharpen while you're at Turing? Any area you consider a weakness that you'd like to strengthen? 
* What are some steps you could take here?
* How could you be aware of progress you're making?
