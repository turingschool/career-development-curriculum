### Opening Activity
In your journal, draw a line down the page. On the left side, write down all your strengths. On the right side, write down all the strengths/qualities of a software developer. Circle or put a star next to the ones that overlap.

### The Why: Coming Full Circle
Throughout this module, we've been talking about our strengths as a way to build more awareness of how we work, communicate, and lead. This session serves as a culmination of that work as we begin to connect that understanding to continue to build relationships with each other and begin to tell a cohesive professional story for our new careers.

Today, we'll do a deeper dive into our strengths, values, and social identities.

#### Objectives
* Reflect on your social identities and values and how they inform your place in the tech industry
* Understand how your experiences at Turing connect to others'
* Begin to build your professional story by describing yourself as a software developer

### Activity #1: Social Identity Mapping
*This activity is adapted from the Center for Creative Leadership*

Question to the group: When you think of the words "culture fit," what comes to mind?

This phrase can cause many organizations to form around people who share a common culture and set of values. This makes sense -- we seek out the people who are most like us. However, research shows that organizations are more successful when they incorporate groups of people with very different histories, perspectives, values, and cultures. And more and more organizations are moving towards embracing that idea of diversity. 

Why does this matter to you? 
1. You each bring your own specific culture and set of values to this industry. That is something to be celebrated as you carve out your own niche in the tech industry.
2. By understanding and articulating your culture and values, you are able to relate to others better, work with them more successfully, and demonstrate the growth you achieve through working with others who are both similar and different to you.

So how do we do that? By looking at our **social identities** more closely.

**Social identity** uses parts of a person’s identity to categorize them into groups. All of us are members of multiple groups. Many of us compare the groups we belong to with other groups, typically thinking more highly of our own.

Your social identity is a combination of three broad components: 
* Given: consisting of the conditions that are outside of your control such as birthplace, gender, certain
family roles or physical characteristics
* Chosen: includes the characteristics that you choose such as occupation, hobbies and political affiliation
* Core: made up of the attributes that make you unique as an individual such as behaviors, values, skills, and items from your
given and chosen categories

**I Do:** Facilitator demonstrates how to fill out a social identity map on the board and discusses their own map.

How can we apply these social identity maps to articulating who we are more effectively? Let's look at this example from Josh Mejia, Back End Instructor:

```I grew up in a blue collar town within a family that, while we were close and valued each other, didn't focus much on education. We were near the poverty line for a good portion of my childhood and relied on things such as Section 8, food stamps, and free lunch. Technology was not a passion of mine. In fact, I was convinced I didn't want to work with computers or spend all day sitting at a desk. It took me years to give software a chance. I was playing music with a couple friends who were software engineers and that encouraged me to look into it as a career path. I declined their nudges and continued working blue collar jobs for the first 10 years of my adult life. After growing tired of the options in front of me, I decided to take their advice and started teaching myself HTML and CSS. One of my friends was working with Ruby on Rails, and he recommended I dive a little deeper.```

**Whole Group Discussion:**
* What did you learn about Josh here?
* What are some ways that he discusses his social identity? 
* What do you connect with from what he shared?

Some takeaways here:
* Even though our social identities could cause us to stick with people who are most like us, by sharing our social identities, we begin to see the ways in which our social identities overlap with people who on the surface seem unlike us.
* Understanding our social identities allows us to identify the ways in which we already feel like we're a part of the tech industry, identify the ways we don't *yet* feel that we're a part of the tech industry, and begin to build bridges to incorporate the latter even more.

#### You Do
Using the handout, create your own social identity map: 

1. In the outer ring, write words that describe your given identity: attributes that you had no choice about such as your nationality, age, gender, physical characteristics, certain family roles, possibly religion.
2. In the next ring, list aspects of your chosen identity. Consider including your occupation, hobbies, political affiliation, where you live, certain family roles, possibly religion. Examples are cyclist, mother, engineer, expatriate, college graduate, wife, leader, New Yorker, Buddhist.
3. In the center, write your core attributes—traits, behaviors, beliefs, values, characteristics, and skills that you think make you unique as an individual. Select things that are enduring and key to who you. For example, you may see yourself as funny, artistic, kind, conservative, creative, impatient, musical, family focused, assertive.
4. After you complete your map:
  * Underline the items that are important to you. These are likely to be the terms you would use to describe yourself.
  * Put a plus sign (+) beside the items that you believe clearly demonstrate that you fit into the tech industry.
  * Put a minus sign (-) beside the items that you believe do not demonstrate that you fit into the tech industry.
  * Put a question mark (?) beside the items that you're unsure how they could show your ability to contribute to the tech industry.

### Turn & Talk
* How do you already think that you fit into the tech industry?
* How have you seen yourself using your social identity to become a successful student and developer? 
* What would it look like for some of your minuses or question marks to turn into pluses? In other words, how could some of these traits be assets for the tech industry?

2-3 groups share out for the whole group.

### Pomodoro
Take a 5 minute break!

### Activity #2: Strengths & Values 
Question to the group: when you hear the words "strengths" and "values," what kinds of words come to mind?
Can *struggle* be a strength or a value?  Why/why not? How many of you have struggled at Turing? Probably all of you are raising your hands. That's part of becoming a better software developer as you learn to keep using a growth mindset. 

#### Turn & Talk
Discuss these examples from 3 other staff members on how they utilize struggle with these questions:
* What did you learn about each person?
* What do these stories tell you about how they each use growth mindset against struggle?

* **Amy Holt, Back End Instructor:** ```"I still struggle every day! One thing I learned about myself and my learning style while at Turing is that it's really important I understand the inner-workings of things before I feel ok with implementing them. At first, I just thought I was a slow learner. Connecting my 'speed' in picking up concepts to my need for a deeper understanding helped me be a little more kind with myself. When I'm really discouraged, I try to step back and remind myself of how far I've come and acknowledge that it is always possible to 'do the thing'. "```

* **Leta Keane, Front End Instructor:** ```"I constantly struggle with learning to code! Coding has never been easy for me, never been intuitive, never been anything other than a very conscious, very intentional PROCESS. I had to learn that just because coding is not intuitive for me, it doesn't mean that I can't or shouldn't code. It doesn't mean that I am a weak developer. Instead, I make use of my very strong skills of communication, organization, planning, and logic to work through problems methodically and collaboratively. I am driven by logic that is tempered by empathy. People should have the resources and understanding they need to make informed decisions for themselves and the safety to grow and thrive. I like to share my experiences and knowledge with the people around me, including the times I've messed up, because examples and commiseration are powerful in combatting imposter syndrome and doubt."```

* **Jeff Casimir, Executive Director:** ```"I remember really struggling when I first started learning about functional programming. At that point I had been writing code for 15 years. I started to see that the anxiety about not 'getting it' was actually preventing me from getting it. When I don't understand what I'm doing I like to copy, modify, create. I take something that I know works, from the web or a book or whatever, and just type that out and make it run. Then I start tweaking things. What if I rearrange two lines, change some numbers or values, that kind of thing. I think of it as 'pulling on' the code, seeing how it flexes and changes. Then I delete a chunk of the code and try to write it myself. I think one of my strengths in life and programming is a willingness to experiment. I prefer to move quickly and learn, even if it means making mistakes, rather than sitting and planning. When you're planning you're working with the information you have right now. When you experiment you have the opportunity to gain new perspective/data."```

2-3 groups share out for the whole group.

Now, let's dive into our own strengths and values a little more to explore how we utilize growth mindset and succeed over struggle as software developers. 

As we discuss values, we're talking about: 
* An enduring belief that a specific mode of conduct or end-state of existence is preferable over others.
* A principle, standard, or quality considered worthwhile or desirable.
* What drives our behavior and are directly related to job satisfaction and fulfillment.
* We value some things more than others and these priorities affect the choices we make in life.

**I Do:** Facilitator demonstrates how to complete the strengths and values activity. 

#### You Do
You have 2 handouts:
* A handout with 4 quadrants labeled with *Always Valued, Often Valued, Sometimes Valued,* and *Seldom Valued* 
* A handout listing different kinds of values. Pick 5 values for each of the 4 quadrants. 

*Think about how your Pairin Highest Virtue Class ("Lover of...") fits into your final selections.* 

Respond to these questions in your journal:
* What are your top 5 values for Always Valued?
* How do these values describe who you are?
* How do these values describe your response to struggle?
* What do these values tell you about your career as a software developer? 

### Small Group Discussions
Form groups of 3-4 people to discuss the following questions:

* Why did you come to Turing?
* What helps you overcome challenges at Turing? 
* Knowing your values, what kind of software developer do you believe you'll become?
* As a group, come up with a 

### Whole Group Debrief/Synthesis
Share out:
* How does what we've talked about today relate to your new career as a software developer? What did you learn about yourself?
* Go back to the activity we did at the beginning of the session; as you look back over the two lists that you made, what do you notice?
