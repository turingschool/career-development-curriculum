# PD & Gear Up Plan for Repeating Module One
Repeating the module is an opportunity to not only solidify technical skills but also take advantage of extra time to work on your professional development and take concrete steps for your job search. Mod 1 professional development is focused on these areas:

* Cultivate Self-Awareness
* Understand one's key strengths
* Know how to learn, including how to learn through struggle
* Ownership over one's learning
* Communicate effectively with partners through the entire pairing process from setting expectations to giving feedback
* Express one's own story and strengths
* Manage stress effectively

As you make your plan here, think about how you can push yourself to grow in these areas further.

Here's the breakdown of expectations for repeating the module:
