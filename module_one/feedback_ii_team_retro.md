### Overview of Team Retros 
 Part of agile process (not just for the end of the project)
  * Setting norms for the discussion (maybe have this take the place of the template?)
    * "opening" -- revisit Tuckman's; where are we in the group dynamic cycle? 
    * process ("body")
    * next steps ("closing")
    * A little on sources of interest -- what are you bringing to the conversation? What do you hope to get out of the conversation?
  * What went well? Appreciation feedback! Be specific!
  * What needs improvement? Coaching; About actions and outcomes, not specific people
  * What are the next steps? 

### How to Communicate More Mindfully: Nonviolent Communication Framework
In order to dive into what your feelings/thoughts/concerns/opinions really are in terms of the feedback you need to give, consider the steps to the [Nonviolent Communication Framework](http://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/freeresources/article_archive/heartofnvc_mrosenberg.htm) in order to use our natural *compassion* when communicating with each other.

Similar to the Facts-Feelings-Ask model of having crucial conversations that we discussed in [Learning to Pair](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md) in Module One, the Nonviolent Communication Framework asks you to consider how to be more *mindful* in your communication with others.

* **Whole Group:** What does it mean to be mindful in communication? What would that look like? When is communication *not* mindful?

Who is good at mindful communication? No one -- yet. We often spend our time communicating:

 * Blame (i.e. "this is your fault")
 * Insults ( i.e. "you're a jerk")
 * Labels (i.e. "you're not a big picture person")
 * Criticism (i.e. "you're bad at JavaScript")
 * Comparisons (i.e. "no one else in the cohort has this problem")
 * Diagnoses (i.e. you have a hard time thinking problems all the way through") -- Note: this is a big one!

Nonviolent Communication instead integrates:
* Consciousness: empathy and awareness
* Language: to either create connection or distance
* Communication: knowing to how to ask and how to listen
* Means of Influence: sharing "power" rather than using "power"

NVC Framework follows these steps:

* Observations: Facts without judgments
* Feelings: Harder than it sounds; if you find yourself using "that," "like," or pronouns after the word *feel*, you are not actually saying a feeling
* Needs: You can't figure out what you need until you reflect on your feelings; use positive language and make needs clear
* Requests: Express clearly and ask for a reflection

All of these steps of reflection should take place *before* you have the feedback conversation to clarify your points.

#### Turn & Talk UPDATE EXAMPLES
Find a partner to discuss the following scenarios and come up with an alternative way of phrasing these pieces of feedback:

**Scenario #1: "You should have more confidence."**

**Scenario #2: "I feel inadequate because when I've brought up ideas you haven't been willing to try any of them out today."**

**Scenario #3: "I feel you are not giving 100% to this.”**

For each of the above, discuss:

* What alternatives could you use for these? 
* What could be a blind spot here? Tone of voice -- you don’t want to come across as passive aggressive
* How can you align intent and impact?

### Activity: Team Retros
Choose a format to run your retro and grab a chart paper (or 2) and copious post-its! You have 20 minutes to retro in your team. Remember to end with actionable next steps for your team to take.

### Debrief/Closing
2-3 groups share out their takeaways from the retro:
* What next steps are you focused on in your project? How did you decide on those steps?

Reminder about deliverable:
* Submit a reflection on using agile and participating in retro feedback using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/agile_feedback_reflection_guidelines.md) in survey provided by 9am on Friday of Week 5
