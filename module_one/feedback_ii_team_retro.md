**Before the session starts:** 

1. Grab these materials:
* Chart paper
* Post-it notes
* Markers
2. Instruct students to sit in their project groups

#### Objectives & Why:
Objectives of our session today:
* Understand what a retro is and what it can look like in practice
* Build on your feedback process by using the Nonviolent Communication Framework to increase the mindfulness in your communication
* Execute a successful retro in your project groups

#### Reminder: Deliverable
Submit a reflection on using agile and participating in retro feedback using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/agile_feedback_reflection_guidelines.md) in survey provided by 9am on Friday of Week 5

**Slide #4:**

#### Why are we talking about retros?
* This is a part of the agile process
* This is how you continue to build strong communication skills
* Strong communication leads to better software

**Slide #5:**

#### Reflection
Take 2 minutes to reflect on the role you've taken in your project so far in terms of how you're using your strengths and leadership style. Reminder about the four domains:

* **Executing:** Team members who have a dominant strength in Executing are those you turn to time and again to implement a solution. These people work tirelessly to get something done. People who are strong in the Executing domain have an ability to take an idea and transform it into a reality within the organization they lead
* **Influencing:** People who are innately good at influencing are always selling the team’s ideas inside and outside the organization. When you need someone to take charge, speak up, and make sure your group is heard, look to someone with Influence.
* **Relationship Building:** Relationship Builders are the glue that holds a team together. Strengths associated with bringing people together -- whether it is by keeping distractions at bay or keeping the collective energy high -- transform a group of individuals into a team capable of carrying out complex projects and goals.
* **Strategic Thinking:** Those who are able to keep people focused on “what they could” be are constantly pulling a team and its members into the future. They continually absorb and analyze information and help the team make better decisions.

**Note to Facilitator #1:** Call on 1-2 students to share their reflections.

**Slide #7 & #8:**

### Overview of Team Retros 
Agile is all about continuous improvement, and retros are an important part of that process.

#### What is a Retrospective?
Notes from [Do's and Don't's: How to Conduct Effective Retros](https://www.inloox.com/company/blog/articles/do-s-and-don-ts-how-to-conduct-effective-retrospectives/):
* It's a meeting that happens at the end of a scrum sprint/iteration and at the end of a project. *This is part of the agile process*
* This meeting is an opportunity for the project team to look back at what they have achieved during the last sprint, what went really well, and what could be improved. 
* **The focus is not on how the product or deliverable could be improved but on how the team can collaborate more effectively to generate better outcomes.** 
* Retrospectives are great for helping teams understand each other better and facilitate better collaboration which in turn leads to improved productivity. *The emphasis is on continuous improvement and change, instead of blindly following the same old procedures and processes.*

**Slide #9:**

#### How to Get Started: Set Norms
Ask yourselves: where are you in Tuckman's Group Life Cycle? Knowing where you are will help you figure out the norms you need to start with. 

**Slide #10:**

Here are some you might want to consider (from [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective)):

* Embrace a positive spirit of continuous improvement and share whatever you think will help the team improve.
* Don't make it personal, don't take it personally.
* Listen with an open mind, and remember that everyone's experience is valid (even those you don't share).
* Set the boundary of your discussion – is it that last sprint? the last quarter? since the project started? Be clear how far back you're going to go.
* Encourage the team to embrace an improvement mindset, away from blame.

What other norms might need to be established in order to fulfill our principles of being **specific, actionable, and kind**?

**Slide #11:**

**Note to Facilitator #1:** Instruct students to designate one person on the team to be the notetaker and to discuss the following questions to set norms for their group. Then call on 1-2 teams to share out some of the norms they came up with after they've had 5 minutes to discuss. **Note Both Facilitators:** While the students discuss their norms, hand out about 4-5 post-its per person by leaving stacks at the beginning of each row. 

**You Do:** As a team, spend 5 minutes discussing where you are in the Tuckman's Group Life Cycle and setting norms for your retro discussion. 

**Slide #12:**

#### How to Get Started: Prepare
Now that you've set norms, be ready to discuss:

* Appreciations: celebrate what’s gone well with the team!
* What have you learned?
   * About yourself
   * About others
* Again, where are you in the Tuckman’s Group Life Cycle? What does the team need to keep moving forward?
* What would you like the team to improve on?

**Slide #13:**

#### Process
Start with **what went well**:

* Appreciations: make these specific!
* How can these appreciations continue to be replicated?
* What strengths have you observed people using?

**Slide #14:**

Then move to **what needs improvement**:

* Coaching: what can the group do better? How can we move to a performing stage of Tuckman's?
* Follow your norms: this is about actions and outcomes, not specific people

**Slide #15:**

And finally, move to **next steps:**

* What will you change as you move forward as a group? For a retro to be really effective, your team needs to actually make change
* Come up with actionable steps, discuss them as a team, agree to which actions you will take, assign owners and a due date to get them DONE.

**Slide #16:**

One particular activity you might want to try to structure this is the 4 Ls:

* What did you *like*?
* What did you *learn*?
* What did you *lack*?
* What do you *long for*?

You could set this up through quadrants with your post-its.

**Slide #17:**

**You Do:**
Write out on your post-its:

* What’s gone well so far?
  * Who do you want to appreciate?
  * How can your team keep this up?
* What could improve?
  * What can your team do better?
* What actionable next steps do you want to take?
  * How can you move to the next stage of Tuckman’s?

**Facilitator #2:** Using Slides #19-30, go through the following:

**Slide #19:**

### How to Communicate More Mindfully: Nonviolent Communication Framework
In order to dive into what your feelings/thoughts/concerns/opinions really are in terms of the feedback you need to give, consider the steps to the [Nonviolent Communication Framework](http://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/freeresources/article_archive/heartofnvc_mrosenberg.htm) in order to use our natural *compassion* when communicating with each other.

Similar to the Facts-Feelings-Ask model of having crucial conversations that we discussed in [Learning to Pair](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md) in Module One, the Nonviolent Communication Framework asks you to consider how to be more *mindful* in your communication with others.

**Note to Facilitator #2:** Ask the class: "What does it mean to be mindful in communication? What would that look like? When is communication *not* mindful?" and solicit 2-3 responses to discuss the difference. 

**Slide #20:**

Who is good at mindful communication? No one -- yet. We often spend our time communicating:

 * Blame (i.e. "this is your fault")
 * Insults ( i.e. "you're a jerk")
 * Labels (i.e. "you're not a big picture person")
 * Criticism (i.e. "you're bad at JavaScript")
 * Comparisons (i.e. "no one else in the cohort has this problem")
 * Diagnoses (i.e. you have a hard time thinking problems all the way through") -- Note: this is a big one!
 
 **Slide #21:**

Nonviolent Communication instead integrates:
* Consciousness: empathy and awareness
* Language: to either create connection or distance
* Communication: knowing to how to ask and how to listen
* Means of Influence: sharing "power" rather than using "power"

**Slides #22-26:**

NVC Framework follows these steps:

* Observations: Facts without judgments
* Feelings: Harder than it sounds; if you find yourself using "that," "like," or pronouns after the word *feel*, you are not actually saying a feeling
* Needs: You can't figure out what you need until you reflect on your feelings; use positive language and make needs clear
  * Note about the word *need*: if this is uncomfortable, you could try appreciate; but we encourage you to practice saying “this is what I need to feel more productive/excited/happy with this project”
* Requests: Express clearly and ask for a reflection

All of these steps of reflection should take place *before* you have feedback conversations to clarify your points.

**Slide #27:**

**Note to Facilitator:** Depending on time, you might consider doing the following as a whole group discussion by cold calling on 2-3 students rather than having a turn and talk. Discuss how the words "feel" and "need" are being used in each of the examples. 

#### Turn & Talk
With a partner, discuss the following conversations. Are they using the NVC framework effectively? If not, how could the statement be changed to be more effective and mindful?

**Scenario #1:** "I feel like not everyone in the group is giving 100%." 

**Scenario #2:** "I feel inadequate because the group hasn't been listening to me."

**Scenario #3:** "Other groups are further ahead than we are. We have to get back on track. I need everyone to work harder." 

**Slide #29:**

### Activity: Team Retros
Choose a format to run your retro and grab a chart paper (or 2). You have 15 minutes to retro in your team:

1. Review your norms again
2. Post your post-its & discuss:
  * What trends do you see?
  * What do you want to keep doing?
  * What do you want to stop doing?
  * What didn't we say in the initial DTR that we should have addressed?
3. Decide on action steps:
  * What are the next steps?
  * Who is owning that action step?
  * When will it be done by?
4. Put your next retro on the calendar
  * Assign roles: facilitator, timekeeper, notetaker, etc.

**Slide #30:**

### Debrief/Closing
2-3 groups share out their takeaways from the retro:
* What next steps are you focused on in your project? How did you decide on those steps?

Reminder about deliverable:
