# Career Journal Template - 2003 Cohort

* [Week 1 Prompts](#week-1)

* [Week 5 Prompts](#week-5)

## Overview
* **What is a career journal?** The journal will help guide you through the process of discovering who you are as a new developer and how that translates into your career goals.  It’s a way to check in with yourself through self-reflection, prompts, and questions, organize your targeted job search, and remember who you met as you build a professional network.   
* **Make it your own.** Add questions and areas to reflect on each week. Just don’t forget to share all of your successes and achievements along the way! 
* **Ongoing progress checks.** Throughout the module, you'll respond to the other prompts and update your progress in your document during professional development workshops and set aside work time. 
* **Module Expectations.** A completed career journal is required for successfully passing the module. The career development team will be assessing your progress throughout the module, and you will submit it for final review in week 6. You will also include highlights from your progress in your end of module portfolio presentation. 

### Directions
1. Copy the following into your own gist or Google Doc. You'll be sharing this with the Career Development Team. 
2. At the end of week 1, you'll submit the link to your journal in a survey provided to you by Allison. Please DM her with any questions you have. 

### Mod 2 Week 1: Creating Your Vision, Part I <a name="week-1"></a>
1. Start Where You Are (Empathize with the user -- *you*):
* Health: how you answer “how are you”; intersection of physical, mental, and emotional health
    * How would you rate your overall health on a scale of 1-5?
    * How do you currently make time for activities associated with your health? 
    * What is a small change you could make here to readjust your health ratings?
* Work: what you do
    * Make a short list of all the ways you work right now
    * How much value do each of those things bring to your life? How are those activities purposeful for you?
* Play: what brings you joy? Think about joy just for the pure sake of doing it; everyone benefits from this kind of play 
    * What activities do you do that bring you joy throughout an average week?
    * In what ways could you make a small change to bring more joy into your life?
* Love: sense of connection; who are the people who matter in your life and how is love flowing to and from you and them?
    * How does love currently show up in your life?
    * How do you show love to others right now?
    * What adjustments would you like to make in this area?
* Looking back at the 4 areas, do any problems emerge that you want to begin designing solutions for?

2. Define your needs, problem, and insights:
* Based on what you wrote about above and your group conversation, what problems have you identified that you'd like to design solutions for?
* What do you already about what you want for your career? What do you still need to find out?
* Who or what do you want to grow into by the end of the Turing program? 

3. Ideate -- challenge assumptions:    
* When you discussed software developers with your small group on Monday, what assumptions came up about what software developers actually do? 
* What steps could you take to challenge those assumptions and find more facts to answer the question of what developers do?
* In addition to what a typical software developer life could look like, what do you want yours to include?

4. Prototype -- start creating solutions:
* What is the basic threshold that your new career must meet after Turing? 
* What would you hope WILL NOT happen in your future after Turing?
* What is your absolute, no-holds-barred, ideal dream for your future after Turing?

5. Test –- solutions:
* Based on this week of reflections, write out your vision statement for your career:

### Mod 2 Week 2: Creating Your Vision, Part II <a name="week-2"></a>
1. Design Thinking Review: [Cultivating Beginner's Mind](https://mindfulambition.net/beginners-mind/)

* How can beginner's mind be helpful when it comes to thinking about your career and job search?
* What are some habits you could put into place to cultivate beginner's mind regularly? 

Optional additional reading: [How to Cultivate Beginner's Mind to Become a True Expert](https://medium.com/better-humans/how-to-cultivate-beginners-mind-to-become-a-true-expert-b2e82953318d)

2. Workview & Lifeview
* Summarize what good, worthwhile work means to you (Tip: this is NOT about what work you want to do but about why work matters to you):
* Lifeview: summarize what you value in life; what matters to you?
* Where do your views on work and life complement each other?
* Where do they clash?
* Does one drive the other? How?

3. Go through the [Flower Exercise brainstorming worksheets linked here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLe95AA3y8rxnU-MDnyAVeoqWCxE9__KMDhmPgcd_7c/edit?usp=sharing)

4. Complete your [Flower Exercise final worksheet here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ETSoRT-BxMH-cTWzbk1inRESmYHGnpbz0DgBHgmAJ-4/edit?usp=sharing) and link that worksheet here.

5. Write a refined vision statement here (what new things have you discovered this week to incorporate into your vision statement?):

### Mod 2 Week 3: Job Search Strategies <a name="week-3"></a>
Reflect on how you’ve spent your time so far at Turing to gauge your engagement and energy:
* When have you been excited, focused, and enjoyed your work?
* When have you felt bored, restless, or unhappy?
* When do you feel energized in your work?
* When is your energy drained?

Setting up habits and routines to make time for the job search this module:
* Block out time on your calendar this week to work on your job search. When will you make this happen? How will you hold yourself accountable to this? What activities will you focus on during this time this week? What outcomes do you hope to reach by the end of this week because of these activities?

Applying wayfinding to using job search resources
* Go through the resources [listed here](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/resources/finding_opportunities.md) and explore 2-3 tools. List what you looked at here:
* Apply wayfinding: of what you looked at, what did you discover that aligns with your vision? If it didn't align with your vision, what will you try next?
* Find a job posting that aligns with your vision. What's the posting? How does it align with what you're looking for? Add it to your Huntr.
* What next steps will you take to explore that opportunity and find contacts? Add that information to your Huntr card.

### Mod 2 Week 4: <a name="week-4"></a>
Mind Maps:
* 1. **Engagement.** What did you reflect on last week in regards to when you're engaged in your work at Turing? Pull out an idea that resonates with you most (e.g., "Talking through a problem with a partner," "The moment when I solve a problem that I previously didn't know how to do," "Setting up a successful project management process for my team") and break that idea down into parts and make a list (what are all the steps that go into that moment? When do you get to use your strengths? What is fun about this?).
* 2. **Energy.** What did you reflect on last week in regards to when you feel most energized in your work at Turing? Pull out an idea that resonates with you most and break that idea down into parts and make a list (what are all the steps that go into that moment? When do you get to use your strengths? What is fun about this?).
* 3. **Flow.** When have you had an experience recently in which you were in a state of flow? You can also think about this as "joy" or "play." Pull out an idea that resonates with you most and break that idea down into parts and make a list (what are all the steps that go into that moment? When do you get to use your strengths? What is fun about this?).

Prototype: what do these mind maps tell you about what's important to you as a software developer? What questions do they bring up about what you still want to learn about this career? 

Outreach & Networking Plan: Based on your reflections above, create a plan to answer these questions: 
* Who is the right person for you to reach out to? 
* How will you find them? How do you know they’re the right person?
* How will you reach out?
* What questions do you need to ask them?
* How will you use this information to further your solution?
* How will you follow up? 

Execute your plan:
* Reach out to your contact THIS WEEK. If possible, reach out to more than one person OR find a meetup to attend also. What happened? What other next steps should you take? If this is a person connected to a company you're interested in, be sure to add it to your Huntr card.
