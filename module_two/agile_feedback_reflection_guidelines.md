# Agile & Feedback Reflection Guidelines
In interviews, you'll be asked about how you approach working in projects, and being able to describe how you utilize agile processes is a great way to help you stand out as a junior developer candidate. This reflection is meant to help you develop this skill.

With that in mind, please answer the following questions in your own gist about your group project:

1. What have you learned about the use of agile vs. waterfall in software projects? 

2. How did you and your group approach project management in this project (what tools did you use, how did you hold each other accountable, etc.)?

3. What role did you take on in the project? 

4. What changes would you make to your approach in future team projects?

5. How does retro function in a team project?

6. In your team retro, how did you engage in the feedback process? What principles of feedback did you use in these conversations?

7. How would you describe your ability to communicate feedback? How has this experience affected your communication skills? How do you want to improve in your ability to communicate feedback?
