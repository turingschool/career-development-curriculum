### Opening
Why is working on our skills for giving and receiving feedback so important? Why have we chosen this as a skill for you to work on in your career development at Turing?

* Whole group discussion
* Discuss objectives and deliverable

Last module, we focused on giving written feedback. Today, we'll discuss techniques for providing feedback in a face-to-face conversation. 

### Review: Intent vs. Impact
Whole Group Review:

* What do we mean by *intent* and *impact*?
    The intent (the purpose behind the giver's message) may not always align with its impact (how the receiver is affected by the message) in conversation. 

Turn & Talk: 
* How might intent and impact function differently in a verbal conversation vs. written feedback? 
* What are some norms you might want to set when having an in-person feedback conversation in order to more fully align your intent with your impact?

2-3 groups share out. 

### Review: Blind Spots & Biases
Blind spots are always present as a gap between the self we think we present and the self that others see. Even with good intentions, your thoughts and feelings can affect the impact of your communication through behaviors that you don't always notice. These can include:

* Your facial expressions
* Your tone of voice
* Your behavior patterns

Biases are present unconciously or consciously:
* Positive bias towards someone can cause us to not give necessary constructive feedback
* Negative bias towards someone can cause us to be overly critical in our feedback

#### Whole Group Discussion:

* What might blind spots look like in conversation? Looking for examples.
* How does a certain blind spot affect the impact of the message?
* How can you be more aware of your blind spots?

### Communicating Feedback in Conversation
Ask for the type of feedback you want - and prime yourself for triggers that could arise in response to it. Reminder - the 3 types of feedback are:

* Appreciation
* Coaching
* Evaluation

How to conduct a feedback conversation:
* **Open** the conversation by getting aligned
   * Define the purpose of the conversation
   * What kind of feedback are we discussing?
   * What does the giver want to give me?
   * Is the feedback negotiable or final? A suggestion or a command?
* **Body:** Two-way exchange of information
   * Listening
   * Asserting
   * Managing conversation process
   * Problem-solving
* **Close** by committing to action

Whole Group Debrief:

* What will make this conversation different with a project team vs. having this conversation with just one partner?

### Nonviolent Communication Framework
In order to dive into what your feelings/thoughts/concerns/opinions really are in terms of the feedback you need to give, consider the steps to the [Nonviolent Communication Framework](http://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/freeresources/article_archive/heartofnvc_mrosenberg.htm) in order to use our natural *compassion* when communicating with each other.

Similar to the Facts-Feelings-Ask model of having crucial conversations that we discussed in [Learning to Pair](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md) in Module One, the Nonviolent Communication Framework asks you to consider how to be more *mindful* in your communication with others.

* **Whole Group:** What does it mean to be mindful in communication? What would that look like?

Who is good at mindful communication? No one -- yet. We often spend our time communicating:

 * Blame (i.e. "this is your fault")
 * Insults ( i.e. "you're a jerk")
 * Labels (i.e. "you're not a big picture person")
 * Criticism (i.e. "you're bad at JavaScript")
 * Comparisons (i.e. "no one else in the cohort has this problem")
 * Diagnoses (i.e. you have a hard time thinking problems all the way through") -- Note: this is a big one!

Nonviolent Communication instead integrates:
* Consciousness: empathy and awareness
* Language: to either create connection or distance
* Communication: knowing to how to ask and how to listen
* Means of Influence: shoaring "power" rather than using "power"

NVC Framework follows these steps:

* Observations: Facts without judgments
* Feelings: Harder than it sounds; if you find yourself using "that," "like," or pronouns after the word *feel*, you are not actually saying a feeling
* Needs: You can't figure out what you need until you reflect on your feelings; use positive language and make needs clear
* Requests: Express clearly and ask for a reflection

All of these steps of reflection should take place *before* you have the feedback conversation to clarify your points.

#### Turn & Talk
Find a partner to discuss the following scenarios.

**Scenario #1: "Don't be so quiet"**

Possible alternative: "I'd like to hear you contribute your thoughts more often."

**Scenario #2: "I feel inadequate because when I've brought up ideas you haven't been willing to try any of them out today."**

Possible alternative: We might add "...and I need you to acknowledge my ideas, discuss them with me, and try them sometimes."

**Scenario #3: "I feel you are not giving 100% to this.”**

Possible alternative:  “I feel frustrated that you have not been able to be here this week to work on our project.  Could we agree on times that we can work on this together so that we can both be focused on the same thing?” 

For each of the above, discuss:

* What could be a blind spot here? Tone of voice -- you don’t want to come across as passive aggressive
* How do you feel about these alternatives?
* Would you say anything different to try to realign intent and impact more?

### Switchtracking
When you're receiving feedback in a conversation, it's easier to fall prey to our triggers because we're experiencing them right in the moment. We often experience relationship triggers during a feedback conversation because of the way the other person delivers the feedback. A common reaction to this trigger is Switchtracking. Switchtracking occurs when we stop listening to what the person is saying and instead focus on our issues with the person. Here's what it looks like:

| Steps | Result |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| Step 1 | You get feedback | 
| Step 2 | You experience a relationship trigger and may question the person's skills/judgment, credibility, or intentions |
| Step 3 | You change the topic to how you feel |
| Step 4 | You talk past (or think past) the other person who continues to stay on the original topic. |

Suddenly, neither of you are on the same page, and the feedback isn't getting heard. 

#### Tips for Getting Back on Track
* Spot the two topics, the original one and the relationship one. You must increase your awareness of what's happening. 
* Separate the who from the what. Discuss each separately on its own track
* Help the feedback giver be clear about their meaning
* Explore the dynamic in the relationship and identify what each of you is doing that contributes to the problem
* When you get coaching feedback, watch for possible relationship issues that might lurk below the surface

Discuss example with whole group:

| Feedback Giver | Feedback Receiver |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| I'd like to see you ask for my input more. | You don't trust me to complete this on my own? |

* What two topics are being discussed here?
* How could you address both of these topics on their own tracks?
* How could the feedback giver be more intentional with their feedback?

#### Small Group Discussions
In groups of 3-4, discuss how to address this switchtracking conversation. Start by identifying what the two topics are, and how they might be addressed. Discuss how this feedback conversation might look in the opening, body, and close in order to align intent with impact as closely as possible. 

| Feedback Giver | Feedback Receiver |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| Please make sure to follow the system we set up with Waffle cards. There were a few times where you started working on a Waffle card but not indicating that you were working on it by moving it to the "In Progress" column, and work got duplicated. | I told you what I was doing when we were sitting next to each other. You don't seem to be listening to me. |

### Putting it into Practice: Having the Conversations
Now is the time to prepare for giving feedback to your project partners in conversations:

* BE: Bike Share (multiple partners)
* FE: Game Time (1 partner)

* 1. **Reflect:** Write down any key points, think about how you can clearly explain your intent, and take into consideration what kind of feedback you need from the other 
* 2. **Schedule the conversation:** 
      When you have the conversation, make sure to follow the Open-Body-Close format for this conversation, and ask clarifying questions. 
* 3. **Plan for follow-up:** This is one conversation on how the project went, but consider any conversations you may want to have after taking time to absorb the feedback

### Final Reflection & Next Steps
* Complete a personal reflection:
    * What is your biggest challenge when giving feedback to someone else? What will you need to be aware of to overcome that challenge? 
    * In a year from now, if you’re practicing these conversations regularly, how will your communication skills have changed? 

* As your project wraps, make sure to have any continued or follow-up conversations with your project partners, including a full retro. 

* Reflect in your deliverable using the [template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_conversation_reflection_guidelines.md) on at least 1 feedback conversation *(but you should be having conversations each time you work with someone else)*
