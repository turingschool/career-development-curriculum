[Slides for this session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lH5XdpZSGBr6vgFU2yDESI1VnsJ-7Pbihh4joe3pUBI/edit?usp=sharing)

### Session Structure

Length: 60 minutes

* Opening (2 mins)
* Reflection & Turn & Talk (8 mins)
* Process for Implementing Feedback (15-20 mins)
  * Right & Wrong Spotting
  * Look for Themes
  * Analyze Priorities
  * Name One Thing
  * Experiment: Try It Out 
* Johari Windows & Personal Reflections (30 mins total: 20 mins. on Johari Windows, 10 mins. on personal reflection)
* Closing (3 mins.)

### Why
In your third and final feedback session, we'll spend time reflecting on how we can find meaning in the feedback we receive and make concrete action plans for how to improve our practices and behaviors. 

What value is there in using feedback for personal growth? Why is this something we're talking about at Turing?

### Objectives

* Analyze our reactions and feelings about feedback
* Utilize a process for implementing feedback
* Use the Johari Window technique to recognize your own blind spots
* Create goals for how to improve your collaboration practices

### Optional Deliverable
Use your Johari Windows and to complete [this reflection](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_implementation_strengths_reflection.md) 

### Taking Feedback
Reflect on these questions in your journal and then **Turn & Talk** to discuss your ideas with a partner:

* When in your life have you taken feedback to heart and tried to do something with it? 
* What was that process like? 
* What was the result? 

**Whole Group Debrief:**

* What kind of process might you implement here at Turing?
* Based on this discussion, where would you like to see a change in your attitude towards feedback?

### Process for Implementing Feedback
It can sometimes be difficult to know what to do with the feedback we receive, so today we'll talk through a process for how to implement feedback effectively:

* Right & Wrong Spotting
* Look for Themes
* Analyze Priorities
* Name One Thing
* Experiment: Try It Out 

#### Right & Wrong Spotting
When we receive feedback, often our first reaction is that it's wrong or unhelpful. That's a valid feeling resulting from a trigger and the impact that the feedback has on you -- go with it. Pay attention to why you're having this impact. 

**In the moment:**
Hone in on your internal voice to pay attention to what could be triggering you:

| Internal Voice | Listen For: | Ask: |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| **TRUTH**<br>That’s wrong.<br>That’s not helpful.<br>That’s not me | **Data** they have that I don’t and interpretations they have that are different from mine<br>**Impacts** I’m hearing that I may not be aware of because of my blind spots | Can you give me an example?<br>What did that mean to you?<br>What are your concerns?<br>What do you see me doing that’s getting in my own way?<br>How did that affect you? |
| **RELATIONSHIP**<br>After all I’ve done for you?<br>Who are you to say?<br>You’re the problem, not me. | **Changing the topic** to the relationship<br>**Systems** between us; what each of us is contributing to the relationship tensions | Help me understand your feedback then I want to talk about some of my relationship concerns.<br>What do you see me contributing to the problem between us?<br>What is most upsetting to you and why? |
| **IDENTITY**<br>I screw up everything.<br>I’m doomed.<br>I’m not a bad person, am I? | **My wiring:** how sensitive I am to feedback and how quickly I recover<br>**Opportunities** for me to sort through for coaching; what I can use for growth and learning | Help me put your feedback in perspective with how you view me overall.<br>What could I do that would help me improve?<br>What could I change that would matter most to you? |

**Upon further reflection:**
Use the Right & Wrong Spotting Technique to turn the feedback into something useful. Start by listing everything that seems wrong about the feedback. And then go back through the feedback and pull out what might be *right* about it -- what truth is there in this feedback? What is something that you can easily implement?

| Wrong | Right |
| ------ | ---------------- | 
| What do I not agree with about this feedback? | What is something right that I can use from this feedback? |

#### Look for Themes
Of the feedback you've received, what themes are emerging?

**Appreciation:** What do others see me doing well? Where am I improving?

**Coaching:** How do my partners/instructors/mentors think I can improve?

Group these answers into areas that help you parse through the feedback:

Example:
| Project | Paired Project #1 | Paired Project #2 | Paired Project #3 |
| ------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Appreciation | -Effective communication using Slack<br>-JavaScript/Ruby skills help produce clean code | -Less merge conflicts in this project<br>-CSS looks better, closer to spec<br>-Helped group increase communication through daily retros -Helped partner write cleaner code | -Using Waffle to keep group on track and increase communication<br>-TDD scores moved up to 3 |
| Coaching | -Using Git<br>-TD<br>-CSS | -Using GitHub for code review<br>-Tests only sometimes pass | -Tagging partners in PRs regularly |
 
#### Analyze Priorities
Now that you have your buckets of feedback, decide what's most important to you to both strengthen and improve. Order your priorities in a list:

*From the example above:*
1. 

#### Name One Thing
Out of those priorities, pick one thing that feels both doable and important for you to try. *If you've analyzed your priorities thoroughly, this one thing should be 1 or 2 on your list:*

#### Experiment: Try It On & Try It Out
You should never expect to change your habits completely in one day. It's not necessary, and it might put undue pressure on you to change. Instead, think about the first step of implementing feedback as an *experiment.* This is your chance to see what fits about the feedback and what feels doable to move forward with.

Consider:

* How to try it out in a low-stakes environment
* How your perspective changes
* What's the worst thing that could happen? *By answering that question for yourself, you may see that there is little downside*

Creating a process for yourself can help take the ego out of the equation as you focus on building the skill of self-improvement. 

### Putting It Into Practice: Johari Windows
Created by psychologists Joseph Luft and Harrington Ingham in 1955 (and named for them, combining the names Joe and Harry), the Johari Window is a technique used to help people better understand their relationship with themselves and others.

Complete the [Johari Window activity](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/johari_window_activity.md) using the adjectives you and your teammates identified for you ahead of time. Create your own copy of the [Johari Window](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IFaKPTEA3V96i8cboxqeAfgKEyEbigwIxQ5KQ-lp440/edit?usp=sharing).

Analyze:

* What do you notice about each quadrant? 
* For the Blind Spot quadrant, is there anything you'd like to build more awareness around? How will you do that? 

#### You Do
Spend 20 minutes creating your Johari Windows and then the last 10 minutes of this practice time on [your reflection](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/edit/master/module_two/feedback_implementation_strengths_reflection.md).
