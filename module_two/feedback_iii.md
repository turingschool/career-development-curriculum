## How to Use Feedback to Improve

[Slides for this session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lH5XdpZSGBr6vgFU2yDESI1VnsJ-7Pbihh4joe3pUBI/edit?usp=sharing)

### Session Structure

Length: 60 minutes

* Opening (3 mins)
* Feedback Review (12 mins)
* Right & Wrong Spotting (20 mins)
* Johari Windows & Personal Reflections (20 mins. on Johari Windows, 10 mins. on personal reflection)
* Closing (3 mins.)

### Why
In your third and final feedback session, we'll spend time reflecting on how we can find meaning in the feedback we receive and make concrete action plans for how to improve our practices and behaviors. 

What value is there in using feedback for personal growth? Why is this something we're talking about at Turing?

* Whole Group Discussion

### Objectives

* Analyze our reactions and feelings about feedback
* Discuss and apply the Right & Wrong Spotting Technique to feedback reflections
* Use the Johari Window technique to recognize your own blind spots
* Create goals for how to improve your collaboration practices

### Deliverable
Use your Johari Windows and to complete [this reflection](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_implementation_strengths_reflection.md) in a gist to submit via the [PD deliverables submission repo](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/tree/master/deliverable_submissions).

### Feedback Tests Our Growth Mindsets
Review: what is a growth mindset? How do you think feedback might affect a growth mindset?

Pulse Check: How much does this sound like you? Reflect in your journals on these statements:

| To What Degree is this Me? | Never, Occasionally, Sometimes, Often, Always |
| ------ | ---------------- | 
| I love feedback. | 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 | 
| I recognize when I have feedback triggers. | 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 |
| I separate how I'm feeling from the feedback. | 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 |
| I view tough situations as learning opportunities. | 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 |
| I reward myself when I get something helpful from feedback because of the way I handled it.  | 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 |

**Turn & Talk:** 
Turn to the person next to you to discuss your reflections on the above statements. How do you and your partner feel similarly or differently about these statements?

**Whole Group Debrief:**

* What did you and your partner have in common about these statements?
* How did you differ?
* Based on this discussion, where would you like to see a change in your attitude towards feedback?

### Right & Wrong Spotting
When we receive feedback, often our first reaction is that it's wrong or unhelpful. That's a valid feeling resulting from a trigger and the impact that the feedback has on you -- go with it. Pay attention to why you're having this impact. 

**In the moment:**
Hone in on your internal voice to pay attention to what could be triggering you:

| Internal Voice | Listen For: | Ask: |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| **TRUTH**<br>That’s wrong.<br>That’s not helpful.<br>That’s not me | **Data** they have that I don’t and interpretations they have that are different from mine<br>**Impacts** I’m hearing that I may not be aware of because of my blind spots | Can you give me an example?<br>What did that mean to you?<br>What are your concerns?<br>What do you see me doing that’s getting in my own way?<br>How did that affect you? |
| **RELATIONSHIP**<br>After all I’ve done for you?<br>Who are you to say?<br>You’re the problem, not me. | **Changing the topic** to the relationship<br>**Systems** between us; what each of us is contributing to the relationship tensions | Help me understand your feedback then I want to talk about some of my relationship concerns.<br>What do you see me contributing to the problem between us?<br>What is most upsetting to you and why? |
| **IDENTITY**<br>I screw up everything.<br>I’m doomed.<br>I’m not a bad person, am I? | **My wiring:** how sensitive I am to feedback and how quickly I recover<br>**Opportunities** for me to sort through for coaching; what I can use for growth and learning | Help me put your feedback in perspective with how you view me overall.<br>What could I do that would help me improve?<br>What could I change that would matter most to you? |

**Upon further reflection:**
Use the Right & Wrong Spotting Technique to turn the feedback into something useful. Start by listing everything that seems wrong about the feedback. And then go back through the feedback and pull out what might be *right* about it -- what truth is there in this feedback? What is something that you can easily implement?

| Wrong | Right |
| ------ | ---------------- | 
| What do I not agree with about this feedback? | What is something right that I can use from this feedback? |

#### I Do
Allison will model how she would use the Right & Wrong Spotting technique to parse through feedback.

#### You Do
Spend 10 minutes reflecting on feedback that you've received recently. Create a right and wrong spotting table and write out any questions that you have still to clarify that feedback further. You'll need to make sure to ask these questions from your previous partners later!

### Johari Windows
Created by psychologists Joseph Luft and Harrington Ingham in 1955 (and named for them, combining the names Joe and Harry), the Johari Window is a technique used to help people better understand their relationship with themselves and others.

Complete the [Johari Window activity](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/johari_window_activity.md) using the adjectives you and your teammates identified for you ahead of time. Create your own copy of the [Johari Window](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IFaKPTEA3V96i8cboxqeAfgKEyEbigwIxQ5KQ-lp440/edit?usp=sharing).

Analyze:

* What do you notice about each quadrant? 
* For the Blind Spot quadrant, is there anything you'd like to build more awareness around? How will you do that? 

#### You Do
Spend 15 minutes creating your Johari Windows and then the last 10 minutes of this practice time on [your reflection](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/edit/master/module_two/feedback_implementation_strengths_reflection.md). Keep in mind that you'll be coaching each other in the next part of the lesson.
