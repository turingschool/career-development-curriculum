[Slides for this session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZxwdADE5YeyRl_mHAfcQW25QgLSALHo_iKu7eRLLfgg/edit?usp=sharing)

### Facilitator Instructions
There are facilitator notes throughout this markdown to divide up responsibilities in the session, assuming there are 2 instructors (1 BE and 1 FE) in the session. Please read through this markdown ahead of the session, decide who is going to be Facilitator #1 and who will be Facilitator #2, and let Allison know if you have any questions. Prior to the session, [print out enough worksheets for all the students](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Career%20Unit%20-%20The%20Flower%20Diagram.pdf) and pass them out at the beginning of the session. 

#### Before the Session Starts
Facilitators: Drop [this link to the brainstorming sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLe95AA3y8rxnU-MDnyAVeoqWCxE9__KMDhmPgcd_7c/edit?usp=sharing) into the cohorts' Slack channels.

Session Structure: 90 mins

**Facilitator #1:** Using slides #2-7, go through the following: 

**Slide #2:**

* Opening: why is this important? (5 mins)
	* Turn & Talk
	* Objectives & Optional Deliverable
* Overview of Petals & Worksheets: How to do this inventory (20 mins)
	* Demo
* Choose Your Own Adventure: Work Time (30 mins)
* Group Sharing (15 mins)
* Final Reflection: Update the Worksheet (10 mins)
* Share Out/Closing (5 mins)

### Opening
**Slide #4:** 

**Turn & Talk:** Last mod, we discussed using your strengths and social identities as software developers:
* What are some of the ways you see yourself excelling as a software developer?
* What excites you most right now about this career?

**Slide #5:**

### Learning Objectives:

* Describe yourself in 7 different ways to enhance your professional story
* Outline specific priorities for your job search 
* Describe in detail the kind of career you’re looking for

## Recommended Deliverable:
This is not required, but you can **[complete the Flower Exercise 1-pager](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Career%20Unit%20-%20The%20Flower%20Diagram.pdf)** and share it with Allison. You can set up a meeting with her to discuss it further if you would like.

**Slide #6:**

Today we'll talk about the steps you can take to make sure that you continue building those feelings of excitement and passion in your new career as a software developer. After all, you're making this career transition because you weren't happy in your last job -- let's make sure that your happiness is front and center in your new career. 

This relates directly to our mission at Turing as we strive for all students to **succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.**

We'll utilize a job-hunting strategy from [What Color is Your Parachute](http://www.jobhuntersbible.com/) by Richard N. Bolles to unpack your values, goals, and passions to make this job search your most successful and satisfying. 

**Slide #7:**

### Overview: How It Works
The Flower Exercise is designed to help you move through 3 stages:

* The **brain dump** stage to organize your thoughts using these [worksheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLe95AA3y8rxnU-MDnyAVeoqWCxE9__KMDhmPgcd_7c/edit?usp=sharing)
* The **synthesis** stage to summarize the findings in your brain dump
* The **prioritization** stage to narrow down what's most important to you from your synthesis. *That's why you have a single piece of paper -- you need to narrow down your highest priorities to fit onto your Flower worksheet.*

**Facilitator #2:** Using slides #9-13, go through the following:

**Slide #9-10:**
On the following slide (Slide #9), cold call on 1-2 students to answer the question of how they've responded to the question "what do you do" in the past then go over Slide #10
### You're Not a Role
Let's start by recapping the do's and don'ts of professional storytelling. When people have asked you what you do in the past, what have you said? **Note to Facilitator #2:** Cold call 1-2 people to respond to that question. 

Examples: “I was a construction worker.” “I was a marketing manager.” “I was a teacher.” Sound familiar? These kind of declarations are not inherently wrong -- it's important to claim your identity according to the work you love. 

However, stating your identity in this way can lock you into a role; but you’re not a role, you’re a person with many skills and many experiences.

Instead, try saying “I’m a person who…”

* "I’m a person who...is skilled at building things.”
* “I’m a person who...has experience in creating stories to attract customers.”
* “I’m a person who...knows how to explain concepts to others in smaller pieces.”

**Slide #12:**

In this session, you’ll explore who you are from 7 different angles to discover what you want as you start looking for a job. **Because you are not just a software developer now, you are a person who has very specific skills, talents, experience, and goals that make you so much more than *just* a software developer.**

### The Seven Petals
I am a person who…has 7 sides to me:

1. Describe who you are in terms of what you know (favorite knowledges and/or fields of interest)
	* Examples: teaching, writing, providing services to others, etc.
2. Describe who you are in terms of the kinds of people you most prefer to work with and/or the kinds of people you would most like to serve
	* Examples:
		* Work with: Creative people; collaborative teams
		* Serve: People from a certain geographical area; people with certain needs, etc.
3. Describe who you are in terms of what you can do and what your favorite functional/transferable skills are
	* Examples: Project management skills; mentoring/teaching
4. Describe who you are in terms of your favorite working conditions
	* Examples: small company/large company/start-up; remote/in-person
5. Describe who you are in terms of your preferred salary and level of responsibility
	* Examples: working by yourself vs. member of a team vs. supervising others vs. running your own business
6. Describe who you are in terms of your preferred geographical location or surroundings
	* Examples: here or abroad; warm/cold, north/south, east/west, mountains/coast, urban/suburban/rural/rustic -- where would you be happiest, do your best work, and would most like to live?
7. Describe who you are in terms of your goals or sense of mission and purpose for your life. Or the goals/mission you want the organization to have where you decide to work

All 7 aspects are important for your job search; Why?

* If a job only matches 1 or 2 “petals,” it will not be fulfilling to you because it will only allow you to express one or two sides of yourself
* This picture is the most complete of you and defining these aspects will lead you to your dream job

**Slide #13:**

#### Another Note: Pairin
Reminder that your Pairin survey results measured how you work, and from here, you can analyze a lot about what's important to you in your new career. Look at your results to think about:

1. Your Top Thinking Style: how you like to work
2. Your Most Intense Driver: what motivates you the most
3. Your Highest EQ Competency: your mindsets and abilities
4. Your Leading Virtue Class: what you value

How do each of these categories help define your ideal career? 

**Note to Facilitators:**
In the next section (slides #14-20), it's recommended that you take turns presenting each "petal" section. Explain the concept of each petal and show students the corresponding worksheets before giving students work time. Petal #3 requires you to provide 2 story examples (see below).   

### Brainstorming
For each of the "petals" below, complete [the corresponding worksheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLe95AA3y8rxnU-MDnyAVeoqWCxE9__KMDhmPgcd_7c/edit?usp=sharing) to fulfill the brainstorming stages of the Flower Exercise.

* Petal #1: Favorite Knowledges And/Or Fields of Interest
   * Goal: Summarize everything you know; Must have: knowledge from past experiences; Bonus: What you would like to learn
   * Tips: Think of your knowledge as nouns, not traits
   * For brainstorming, use worksheet #1:
     * What you know from the past: go through everything you know; if you worked at a restaurant, this could mean you list “learned how to prepare and serve food, how to wait on customers, how to make change, how to deal with complaints, how to train new employees, etc.” Then go back and highlight the most important pieces to you -- which are you most satisfied with?
     * What you know outside of work: what knowledge have you picked up outside of work?
	* Examples: Things learned in high school/college that you still value today; anything from training seminars, conferences, etc.; anything you learned at home or via the internet
     * What industries sound interesting to you: start broadly and then make more specific
     * Anything else you want to learn

* Petal #2: Preferred Kinds of People to Work With
   * What does this mean? People we work with either give us energy or drain our energy. They’re very important to how we work.
   * Goal: To avoid past bad experiences with people at work, focus on the people you most like to work with
   * Think About:
      * 1. What kind of people surrounding you at work will enable you to operate at your highest and most effective level.
      * 2. What kind of people you would most like to serve or help: defined by problems, geography, etc.
   * Tips: These are descriptions -- adjectives
   * For brainstorming, use worksheets #2 and #3:
      1. List the places you've worked and the people from those places that helped you do your best and those that hindered you along with the people you want to build software for in the future
      2. Party Game Exercise: Looking at the graphic for the party, answer these questions by writing down the letter: 
          * Which corner of the room would you be drawn to as the group of people you’d want to be around longest?
	  * 15 mins. later, everyone in that corner leaves for another party, except you. Of the groups that remain, which group would you be drawn to now?
	  * 15 mins. later, this group also leaves. Of the remaining groups, which do you join?

**Facilitators:** For petal #3, please provide the story from Richard Bolles listed below as well as an example from your own experience. 

* Petal #3: Transferable Skills
   * Goal: Discover what your transferable skills are by breaking them down into 3 groups:
     * People skills
     * Skills with data
     * Skills with things -- your talents, etc.
   * How do you do this? Start by telling a story about yourself when you've worked to accomplish a goal in the past. It doesn't have to be a goal related to a specific job you had. Start by detailing the steps you took to accomplish that goal and then outline what skills were used here.
   * Examples: Richard Bolles, the author of *What Color is your Parachute?*, had a goal to take his family on a vacation. The challenge was that he didn't have a lot of money to spend on hotels, so he decided to rig his family station wagon into a camper (keep in mind: this was the 1970s). He didn't know how to do that, so he started with some research. He researched the materials and tools he would need, drew up plans, measured and cut materials, and began to build the camper. He was successful in building the camper and in taking this family on the vacation. He estimated that he saved over $1200 by not staying in hotels, and by today's standards, that number would have been much higher. He broke down the skills he used to accomplish this goal:
      * Research
      * Visualization
      * Planning 
      * Design
      * Engineering 
      * Construction
      * Follow-through
   * How to brainstorm for this:
      * Using worksheets #4-7, write out a story (or more -- the book recommends 7 so that you can look at patterns of your transferable skills) about a time you accomplished a particular goal. 
      * Then go through and analyze the particular skills you used with the checklist provided
      * In the space on worksheet #7, write out a sentence detailing why you're good at your top 10 skills
   
* Petal #4: Preferred Working Conditions
   * Goal: State the working conditions and culture that would make you happiest and enable you to do your most effective work
   * Tip: Make these statements very specific
   * Good example: Clear diversity and inclusion initiatives, flexible hours with work from home option, regular pairing with a senior dev, team-oriented, encourages asking questions
   * Bad Example: Understanding boss, good colleagues, fun
   * For brainstorming, use worksheet #8 to detail the places you've worked before, what you liked and disliked about those places, including ranking them
     * You can also use the [Key Values Culture Queries quiz](https://www.keyvalues.com/culture-queries) to help you get more specific with your language and figure out how to ask about these things in both coffee meetings and interviews
     * It's also recommended that you look back over your Pairin results to think about how these can help you understand what kind of cultures and values you're looking for. 

* Petal #5: Salary & Level of Responsibility
   * Goal: Gain a realistic picture of how much money you will need or want to earn in your next job as well as your understanding of how much responsibility you want to strive for in your new career.
   * Tip: Think about salary in terms of a range.
   * For brainstorming, use worksheet #9. A couple things to keep in mind:
   	* Median starting salary for Turing grads is $77,750
	* Use the [Stack Overflow Salary Calculator](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/salary) to help narrow down ranges. Put in "bachelor's degree" as equivalent for your Turing education. 

* Petal #6: Preferred place to live
   * Goal: Define where you would most like to work and live to be happiest
   * Important to think about the future now in order to see what opportunities you’re ultimately open to. Reminder that most first jobs as a software developer will last only for 1-2 years, so you could move somewhere else for a job and then come back to Denver afterwards
   * For brainstorming, use worksheet #10, which contains questions for you to consider about places you're open to and those you definitely aren't. There are also some quizzes you can use to see what areas you might appreciate that you hadn't thought of before. 

* Petal #7: Goal/Purpose/Mission in life
   * Goal: Define the values and goals by which you will continue to guide your life in order to analyze the kinds of companies you’d like to work for or types of projects you’d like to create
   * For brainstorming, use worksheets #11-13
   
**Facilitator #1:** Using Slide #22, go through the following:

### Choose Your Own Adventure: Work Time
Now start on the worksheets to think about each of these petals. Think about what's most important to you when it come to unpacking your approach to your job search. This is the brain dump part of the process: use the worksheets, reflect on your past experiences, journal about your passions. 

**Facilitator #2:** Using Slide #24, go through the following: 

### Group Sharing
Find 3-4 people to share some takeaways from your brain dump. This is where you synthesize the information you've been working through by answering these questions:

* What did you discover about yourself and your ideal career in this exercise?
* Did anything surprise you?
* How will you use this information to drive your job search? 
* What do you still want to learn from this process?

**Facilitator #1:** Using Slide #26, go through the following:

### Final Reflection: Create your Flower
From your group discussion, spend a few minutes prioritizing the most important takeaways and then fill out your Flower 1-pager with your most important priorities.

**Both Facilitators:** Also on Slide #26, call on 1-2 people to share out a takeaway from the session

### Share Out & Closing
* What have you learned about yourself today?
* How will you apply this exercise to your job search? 

Remember that you can schedule a coaching session with Allison to talk through your discoveries to help you begin to narrow the scope of your job search.
